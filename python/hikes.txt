"comments":[{"comment": "See additional links below for more trip photos.\r Pup and I slept by the trailhead to catch the early water taxi next morning to Big Beaver Campground. Hiking instead would have added an additional 14 miles to the trip.\r Trail was in great condition, just the occasional down trees we needed to get around. Took a much needed lunch break at Luna Camp before moving on. Just past the camp a junior bear was wandering on the trail, but it disappeared back into the bush after I started making lots of noises.\r More mosquitoes showed up after we left the trail and bushwhacked toward Big Beaver Creek. Unable to find a log jam to cross, pup and I walked up and down the creek bed while fighting our way through devils club and skunk cabbage land. Eventually found a shallower creek bed farther north to cross.\r After creek crossing we began scrambling southward to attain the ridge just north of Access Creek. Found a climbers path in lower part of the ridge but soon lost it underneath down trees and heavy brush. We followed GPS track from a trip report and crossed Access Creek at 3900\u2019 to avoid the alder swatch on the north side.\r Access Creek Basin came into full view just after the crossing, with Luna Peak towering over upper basin. Spotted some cairns as we made the one-mile scramble into the upper basin. After getting there, I found a perfect boulder with a flat top where we set up our camp and turned in shortly after dinner.\r Next morning bulk of our time was getting up the steep gully to Luna\u2019s southeast ridge. From there it was a gradual ascent across the wide southwest basin and onto Luna Pass. We spotted bears tracks leading from south of the pass, over and down the north side. Following southwest ridge to false summit was straight forward, mostly class 2. Getting to true summit from false summit was another story.\r Pup stayed behind while I figured out best way to get down to the ledge on the south side. After getting to the ledge, rest of the traverse became pretty straightforward. Spotted a few cairn along the way for sanity check. It felt like everything on the summit was loose. I clipped myself into an anchor I built around this bomber rock, sat straddling the rock, and took most of the photos that way.\r After spending an hour on top, I started carefully making my way back to the false summit and reunited with the pup. We rest a bit while I took more photos of the Picket Range, then slowly made our way back down to camp. Back on Luna Pass we spotted more fresh bear tracks heading down toward Luna\u2019s south basin.\r Next morning, making our way out of Access Creek  was just as painful as it was on the ascent. Although we made much better time getting back to Beaver Creek and managed to find the log jam half a mile downstream from where we crossed the creek two days earlier. We hiked as fast as we could to get back to Big Beaver Campground, but arrived 10 minutes past the taxi pickup time. The driver (together with grandson) said he wasn\u2019t in any hurry, and even let the pup swim in the water for a bit before getting us back to the southern lake shore.\r The one-mile hike uphill from lake shore back to the trailhead was icing on the cake at the end of a long trip.", "date": "Jun 25, 2016"}, {"comment": "The bullet-proof high pressure ridge assuring clear skies prompted Don B, Carla S, Brett D, and I to consider this remote area of North Cascade National Park as any worry of rainfall was gone. This tallest peak in the Picket Range receives ample precipitation and the summit views offered from this central location include dozens of glaciers that resounded with ice fall during our visit. \r     We took the water taxi to the Big Beaver landing lessening our approach from SR-20 by some seven miles. Then we hiked on the well-maintained Big Beaver trail to ~1 1/2 miles past the established Luna Camp situated at 10 miles uptrail. There is a large rock cairn eight feet to the left of the trail where we made our exit toward Big Beaver. Generally following the line of gravity we zigged and zagged through mucky terrain with skunk cabbage patches and old-growth Devils club forests to eventually reach Big Beaver Creek. Where to cross the Big Beaver Creek is perhaps the crux of the climb. Any logs going over the creek are now gone. That necessitates a ford through swift and cold water. The route I reconned without a pack on did not play out. Brett was successful on his foray and we stripped to our undershorts to cross in mid-thigh level water. \r     Once on the west side of Big Beaver we made a generally southwest traverse to the headwater of Access Creek. We only occasionally saw bootscars of previous climbers in the forest duff. Luna's second line of defense after Big Beaver Creek are the half-dozen slide alder thickets that need to be passed. We crossed Access Creek at ~3,900 ft and six hours after leaving the established trail we reached our campsite located in the meadow adjacent to the rippling headwater for Access Creek from a pocket glacier of Luna Peak at ~ 4,200 ft.\r     The summit pyramid enticed us from 4,100 vertical feet above while we ate our supper shortly before sunset. Sometime during the twilight period the \"snafflehounds\" made their appearance. I was enjoying my tea when I felt something brushing against my leg. I looked down to see the furry rodent brazenly groping me.  Neotoma cinerea is the scientific name of these bushy tailed rodents of the high country. They emerged from their burrows and were quite annoying ever going toward our packs hence their more common name of \"pack rat\". They, like many other animals, have an strong desire for salt and will eat the cork off of trekking poles and chew the inside of boots or the lining of backpacks to satisfy their craving. As a successful defense I made an island of stones in the middle of the stream and marooned by backpack there during the night. My boots were placed on the face of a large boulder where they would have needed to rappel to get to them. Don had a miserable night as he defended himself from his bivy sack. Previously I have had them lick the salt off of my hair while I tried to sleep in a bivy sack. \r      The next morning we ascended the two-thousand feet to get to the col that grants access to the SW Ridge. At this late time in the climbing season the gully is a loose rock pile and our four member party made conscious effort to remain either close together or outside of each other's line of gravity to prevent party inflicted rockfall. We had helmets on for safety just in case. Once at the col the beauty of the Pickets revealed itself. McMillian Spires, Mt Terror, Mt Degenhart, and Challenger made a team effort to provide an inspiring sense of wonder. We made an ascending traverse to reach another col at the edge of Luna's SW Ridge. Leaving our crampons, ice axe, and other unneeded equipment we ascended the easy Class 3 rock to the false summit of Luna. \r      Once at the false summit we discussed various options. Carla saw a line that connected the dots of the two summits. It involved losing ~20 feet to gain access to interconnected ramps and ledges on the SE face (right side) of Luna. From the false summit the prospects look daunting but once on the move we were on the true summit twenty minutes later. Having said that it should be underscored that this route is incredibly exposed. There little leeway for error. A misstep or errant handhold would be fatal. Our route was bone dry and you will want friction to be your ally on Luna. Like our party choose a summit date that is guaranteed to be without precipitation. \r      The descent was along the same lines and after another night camping we returned to the Ross Lake water taxi pickup point.  Our 6:00 PM rendezvous allowed time for a refreshing swim for some members. This adventure is a strenuous endeavor but worth every footfall as it provides supreme views into a pristine wilderness. \r     Hiking distance travelled; 36 1/2 miles Elevation gain; 8,009' Camp-to-camp on summit day; 10 1/2 hrs", "date": "Sep 4, 2014"}],

It's 9 miles to Chancellor. The trail to Boulder Creek is in great shape. After that, like the NFS says, there is a slide that can be difficult for inexperienced hikers and a mis-step here means a plunge into the canyon. But I felt comfortable enough to cross it and back. \r At Mill Creek there are 3 great campsites - one up the hill right after the bridge, and two others I'm not obliged to reveal. Send me a message and I'll tell you where they are if you promise not to post them. \r After Mill Creek it gets pretty quiet - there are signs some people are maintaining this trail but I didn't see anyone and the trail is still in great shape, aside from - 3 slides that are tricky but doable. Watch your step on the first, stay high on the second (the worst) and stay low near the creek on the third after the bridge. \r There are hidden camp sights along the way if you've got time to explore.\r After this there's some brush and overgrowth to Chancellor but it's easy to follow. Great campsites at Chancellor (to the left and right after the bridge). I didn't start up Slate Road.\r However, I did start up the trail to Sky Pilot Pass and from this direction it appears impassable. The trail begins from Chancellor up a boulder field where it comes to a slide area - very gravelly and a straight slide 200 feet down into the rushing creek below. I turned around here as the risk was beyond my comfort level.  Actually it didn't seem risky it seemed guaranteed. There are no boulders or timber on the trail to swing from but the creek might offer an alternate route.\r Tried to follow the Mill Creek trail on the way back but only managed a mile of serious bushwacking. Trail is discernable but it travels up into a burn area that I imagine is even more overgrown and less water. Trip reports dating back 14 years say the same thing. Don't try to follow the Mill Creek Trail (still shown on my North Cascades relief map I picked up at REI a few years ago) unless you've got some advanced route finding skills.\r Overall Chancellor is a great trail for experienced hikers.

Trail is in good condition. We climbed Golden Horn from upper Snowy Lakes that same day. Camped on rocky ridge west of upper Snowy Lake. Climbed Tower Mountain morning of 8/03/07. Stayed at camp overnight. Note: there were at least 17 people camped around upper Snowy Lake Friday night. Pit toilets would be a good idea for this heavily used area. The lakes are small and are the only source of fresh water in the basin. 8/04/07 left camp at upper Snowy Lakes traveling westerly cross country until reaching Trail #2000 north of Methow Pass. Hiked northerly to trail #755. Missed the turn off because the trail is not marked and the tread is faint. Note also that there are no visible signs (or readable signs) of a Horse Heaven camp at the turnoff (unless tall grass = Horse Heaven). Backtracked southerly on Trail #2000 and found a tread in the vicinity we expected to find trail #755. Followed braided treads and game trails for 700 vertical feet before finding trail #755 that took us to Azurite Pass. Climbed Azurite Peak. Camped 300 feet below Azurite Pass to the northwest on heather and larch bench. Trail #755 ended here. 8/05/07 we traveled north, cross country, following cairns until they ran out, then bush-whacked down Mill Creek in search of Trail #755 and Azurite Mine. Found intermittent faint treads, but trail is mostly gone. About 5 cairns over 4 miles of vegetation marked the way. Bush-whacked through heavy brush, slide alder, and mulberry for much of the 4 miles from Azurite Pass to Azurite Mine. Just south of Azurite Mine we dropped packs and climbed Ballard ascending the most southern stream on Ballard that descends from its southern, west facing cirque and below, to the north, of point 7890. Signed the summit register. We were the 20th and 21st people to have signed the register for Ballard since 1998. Descended Ballard back to Trail #755 and began the arduous 3.3 miles (distance seemed longer) of side hilling steep slopes, major washouts, and thick vegetation. Note: the old,wide road that leaves northerly from the Azurite Mine bunkhouse is actually trail #475 that leads up Cady Ridge. Trail #755 is shown on the map as the main trail, but #755 is overgrown and has many major washouts along it and cannot be readily found at 4,000 vertical feet while traveling north from Azurite mine. Maps show trail #475 entering trail #755 from the north east but now trail #475 is the only detectable / followable trail leaving from Azurite Mine. Mill Creek trail #755 is shown on the map to be the main trail that leads from Canyon Creek to Azurite Pass, but most of the trail is difficult to follow, or is gone entirely. After an hour of struggle in the vegetation we found a tread that was at times good, but overall very difficult to follow. We observed many signs of bear activity in the area and we saw a large, cinnamon colored bear (black bear) below us on one of the steep, sandy wash-outs we crossed. We merged with Canyon Creek Trail #754 at 8:30 PM and arrived at the Canyon Creek trailhead at 10:30. We set up on the side of highway 20 and thumbed a ride. We were picked up at 11:00 PM by two nice young men who were heading to Lake Ann trailhead. They took us to our car at Rainy Pass and we arrived at home in Seattle at 3:00 AM. Great trip.

I'm guessing after the big northwest windstorm a month ago a bunch more came down because over a 7 mile stretch there are more like over 200 blowdowns (maybe more?). Most are stepovers but some require reroutes through very thick new growth (see picture). It's very slow going and there are few suitable places to camp on this stretch (and fewer trees to hang a bear bag) and we could clearly tell this is primarily a game trail right now (bear, coyote, deer, elk). \r There are 2 streams at the north end of Big Hidden Lake that require either fording or a very tricky log crossing (with poles).\r Okanagan National Forest web site lists this trail as not having been cleared in the last 4 years. The blowdowns cease (southward) at the Tatoosh Buttes trail connection (there's a temp yellow paper sign) where stock users have kept the trail clear. \r Other than that all the other trails are in great shape. The campground at the south end of Cougar Lake along the outlet is exceptional.", "date": "Sep 16, 2015"}, {"comment": "Seven of us started on a 40+ mile loop, starting at the Billy Goat Trailhead.  We followed the Hidden Lakes Trail #477, E. Fork Pasayten Trail #451; Dollar Watch Pass Trail #451A and Larch Creek Trail #502.  After driving 4 hours from Spokane and hiking 4 miles, we opted to spend the night at the campground at Drake Creek.  Location was spacious, clean, near water and level:)  The next morning we climbed the 1.4 miles across Lucky Pass, on our way to Cougar Lake for our next camp.  The trail was very well maintained, some rocky areas, but as dry as it had been we didn't think it was that bad.  There was a small body of water, surrounded by marsh, which we hoped wasn't our site!  Turned out not to be and the Cougar Lake camp was also very nice.  Our next day was going to take us past the Hidden Lakes, to the East Fork Pasayten Trail for a camp somewhere with the junction of Trail 548.  The trail to the First and Middle Lakes was great - a stop at the Ranger Station built in 1954 and we continued on to Middle and Big Hidden Lakes.  Big Hidden was enveloped in beautiful fireweed, made for some gorgeous scenery.  The blowdowns started at the beginning of Big Lake; trail was overgrown but doable; and the blowdowns continued all on trail 451.  It was a very difficult segment of the trip - we counted at least 100 blowdowns; we spent the next several hours crossing over, crawling under, around, or at times walking under the blowdowns.  The area was closed in 2014 because of fires; very evident.  Lots of new little trees coming up, tho.  Continuing on a few hundred yards on trail 451 from the Junction of McCall Gulch Trail, we found a beautiful camping area across the creek, on a hill to the left.  The remainder of our trip found us hiking in lusher vegetation; beautiful peaks to enjoy; rocky downhills.  We crossed Dollar Pass, Three Fools Pass then spent the last night at a camp close to Drake Creek.  The next morning took us over Billy Goat Pass (appropriately named) and back to the trailhead and the burger and fries in Winthrop.  Awesome trip!!  Perfect hiking weather (70's?) cool mornings, except for a little rain the first night.", "date": "Aug 8, 2015"}, {"comment": "", "date": "Jul 29, 2013"}, {"comment": "", "date": "Aug 6, 2009"}],

Fires were scattered around eastern Washington this year, but once we fearlessly drove thru the smoke in the Mazama valley, the skies cleared for us at the Slate Pass trailhead (4.5 hours from Edmonds, WA). Day 1: Slate Pass to Shaw Creek (8 miles) Slate Pass to Windy Pass on the PCT is gentle traverse with grand views of the glaciers on Jack Mtn to the west. We also see a plume of smoke from a fire burning northeast of us.The trail is very dry - no water until we reach the camps below Windy Pass where there is a small stream, but it is too soon to camp so we hike up and over the ridge and continue down the valley losing a few hundred feet of elevation. This stretch of the trail is all in trees. We hike along looking for the horse camps that are supposed to be situated north and south of Jim Peak. Eventually we find the north side camp with what remains of a dried up Shaw creek \u2013 just a little sandy bottom hole filled with water \u2013 but it was the \u201conly drink in town\u201d so we were glad for it.Day 2: Shaw Creek to Holman Spring (7.5 miles)A late start up to Holman Pass takes just 2 hours and still no water or camps. We continue north to the dry outlet below Goat Lakes and have a quick lunch. In another \u00be miles, the trail takes us up to the extensive meadows of the horse camp below Holman Peak. The camps are fine with spectacular views, year round clear spring water and lots of company in the form of furry little pikas. More than I have ever seen! A fantastic place to camp for the night.Day 3: Holman Spring to Pasayten River (10.5 miles plus 1 mile side trip)We start early today so that we can ascend Rock and Woody Pass in the morning hours while it is still cool. Overnight, clouds have moved in obscuring the distant views and lopping off the top of the peaks across the valley. It is also much cooler. No time at all to Rock Pass, but then we drop down 600\u2019 or so and back up 400\u2019 to Woody Pass. We chat awhile with the first hikers we\u2019ve seen so far who started at Hart\u2019s Pass and are exiting at Ross Lake. They also name the fire that we spotted a few valleys over to the north east. The Tatoosh Butte fire has flared up overnight, but still appears several drainages over from us.Woody Pass is slightly below the actual high point. We dropped our packs and hiked up the PCT to have a look at what was ahead. More traverses along lots of mountains, although the terrain looked a bit less rugged than the immediate surroundings.After the 1 hour side trip, we shouldered our packs and left the PCT, heading down the Rock Creek trail. After about 35 minutes, we crossed the largest creek we had seen so far. (This is notable in that there was a small dry camp at Woody pass that might serve a northbound hiker if they knew water was relatively close.)Continuing on the Rock Creek trail, more creeks and eventually, a very nice camp! The trail is well graded, mostly through meadows and very lush. It resembles the west side of the cascades with frequent streams but no new camps. There are intermittent views in and out of old growth spruce forests and extensive avalanche chutes.There was supposed to be a camp as you approach the valley bottom, but we never spotted it. The trail doesn\u2019t appear to get much use, so any camp trails may be overgrown by the meadows.Eventually we reach the intersection marked Soda Creek (N) and Slate Peak (S). After hiking south for about \u00bd mile, we come across a nice camp on the creek with the water access way, way below. We kept hiking to the intersection with the Robinson Pass trail and dropped down to an extremely comfortable horse camp about 300 feet from the Pasayten River.Day 4: Pasayten River to Buckskin Lake (4-5 miles)It showers off and on overnight and we wake up to cloudy but calm skies. Another early start this morning because there is some uncertainty as to the actual distance to Buckskin Lake. The possibilities based on maps and WTA trip reports range from 4 to 7 miles on a fairly steep trail up the ridge. We continue for a short bit on the Robinson Pass trail meandering through pine forests for one mile to the Buckskin Ridge trail intersection. The trail starts out brushy but with good tread as it ascends the lower part of the ridge through spruce forests. Eventually, we reach the switchbacks and begin ascending in earnest. We see the Tatoosh Butte fire across the valley and it looks tamped down in the moist, cool weather. We reach the very pretty Buckskin Lake in just 4 hours of unhurried hiking. We estimate 4 or so miles versus the 7 miles stated on the GT map. By the time we had set up the tent, the intermittent showers had changed from rain to snow. So typical for the Pasayten in September!Day 5: Buckskin Lake to Silver Lake (5-6 miles)Overnight, the skies cleared and the temperature dropped. We were thrilled as we didn\u2019t want to do this next section with bad weather conditions. The valleys were fog/smoke filled and we could smell the fire for the first time. We spent some time enjoying the lake views before breaking camp. This would be a lovely destination in the fall when the larches are changing, but there is only one large camp so one would have to be lucky and find it unoccupied as it was for us.This next part of our route had some mystery to it. We had no first hand knowledge of its condition and the map indicated stretches of unmaintained trail and \u201csteep and dangerous\u201d areas. There was also a question as to its actual length. The trail passes through beautiful larch and spruce stands and lovely meadows as it winds its way around the base of Buckskin ridge. The valley views, although smoky, are widescreen quality, framing Mt. Rolo and Osceola Peak. After about 1 mile, we enter a box canyon and begin ascending up a steep but well switchbacked trail to Buckskin Pass. We reach the pass 2 hours from camp and enjoy the views of Jack Mtn, Glacier Pk and Mt Baker. Unfortunately, the views are shrouded by smoke which only encourages us to return another time when the skies are clearer.We now descend steeply on fairly good trail and then down some more to go around the end of a small ridge. You then must regain some of the elevation you just lost and here begins the portion of the unmaintained trail. It traverses across very steep meadows with a few areas that make you think about what you\u2019re doing so you don\u2019t tumble down the slopes like a boxcar. This concerns us a bit because we have yet to reach the \u201csteep and dangerous\u201d section. When we finally do reach that section, we find that it is steep but not dangerous, plunging down the meadows to the valley bottom. We\u2019re glad to go down this section rather than up! The remaining 2 plus miles to Silver Lake consists of going up and down over a series of passes. Again, we are amazed at the verdant green of the area. There are a few small camps and several streams and we stop frequently to browse the biggest, juiciest blue huckleberries seen in many years.Six hours from Buckskin Lake we reach Silver Lake and find a yellow tape across the trail barring access to Buckskin Ridge from the south due to the Tatoosh Butte fire. Although the lake looks well used, we once again have it all to ourselves and find a nice camp at the far end. Day 6: Silver Lake to Slate Peak (5-6 miles)Our last day starts off a bit smoky. We start early anticipating the long drive back to town. The trail appears to just traverse the ridgeline on the map but in reality it is once again up and down repeatedly. The views across the valley are lovely and consistent the entire length of the trail. As we approach Slate Peak, we encounter a ranger who informs us that the entire trail system we had hiked had been closed due to fire danger sometime after we began (except for the PCT, which would be closed a few days later). We mulled over our fortunate timing as we hiked up the last bit of trail to Slate Peak. We had unfettered access to the spectacular backcountry of the Pasayten wilderness with hardly another human soul to be found. One of our top five backpacks!Nina\u2019s Crew", "date": "Aug 28, 2006"}],

Overall the trails were clean, clear, well maintained with no snow and just a touch of water in some places. \r First, this is one of the most beautiful areas we've explored to date. The terrain is very diverse, from the burn areas to the wide-open meadows to arctic tundra to the mountainous peaks. We made the 5.5 hour drive from Seattle on 7/2 with a plan to camp overnight at the Iron Gate Trailhead getting an early start the next morning to avoid potential mid-day heat (it was a sweltering 94-degrees when we arrived in Tonasket around 6pm). \r Note: When reaching the town of Loomis it took us a while to find \"make a right onto County Road 9425, and after 2 miles make a left onto Forest Road 39\" (per WTA directions). There are no signs for County Rd 9425, it's actually Loomis-Oroville Rd which 'bears right', then continue for approx 2 miles and go left at Toats Coulee Rd which leads to Forest Road 39. The road up as noted was filled with potholes and washboard sections but not a problem with a higher-clearance vehicle. Periodic groves of lovely Alders and white Birch trees along the way.\r There are a few decent primitive campsites at Iron Gate Trailhead. When we arrived there were a handful of cars and a group/bus from the community college - natural resources. They left in the morning before we started out. There were some bugs (nothing major) and a good deal of deer and [old] coyote scat in and around the campsite (however no visitors in the night).\r We started out on Boundary Tr #533 and through the burn area (from the 2006 fire) - surreal and captivating, especially with the distant peaks visible through the lifeless remnants. After about 2 miles we came upon a meadow filled with wildflowers and yellow-bellied marmots. At one point there were three marmots standing on their hind legs and squawking at us. We stopped for a bit to take in the views. By now it was already quite warm and we underestimated the difficulty of backpacking at 6-7,000 feet of elevation, our first at this level (Iron Gate starts at 6,000 feet). \r We decided with the heat, the elevation and our [not so light] packs to settle and camp in a nice shady area just about .5 miles before Sunny Pass - several good water sources and places to explore. We saw one deer with a soft velvet rack starting to emerge. Throughout the late day we saw just under ten other hikers/pairs come up from Iron Gate. During the night coyotes were howling in the distance (again no visitors in the night).\r The next morning we set out for Smith Lake, .8 miles on Smith Lake Tr #361, east of Boundary #533. A number of hikers had told us that Louden Lake was barely a lake right now (very shallow). We set up camp at Smith Lake situated so that it's surrounded on three sides by snow-covered peaks and rolling hills. Spectacular weather, magnificent views and my partner managed to catch a couple of small rainbow trout for sport (gently returned them to the lake). We hiked around the lake and explored the area where at the very east end, through the woods about .5 miles, the views went on forever. Two other campsites occupied by packers nearby later in the day. Bugs throughout the day but again, not too bad (by evening we did put on just a touch of Deet to keep mosquitoes at bay). The weather here can change from one moment to the next without much warning. At around 8pm it started to get cold with a bit of rain coming our way. During the night it was windy, rainy and cold but thankfully we were snug and warm in our very cozy sleeping bags. By morning the blue skies were back and the ground nearly dry. On our way out on the Smith Lake Tr #361 back to Boundary Tr #533 there was one good blowdown that happened during the night.\r It was Saturday and our intention was to camp out one more night and head out early back to Iron Gate Trailhead and home. Plans don't always emerge as we envision. We decided to go back to Iron Gate via the 8.5 mile Albert Camp Tr #375. It's our first time here and we assumed (don't do that) we'd find a place to camp for the night towards the end of the trail. The trail up Horseshoe Mtn was slow going, wide open with a few good switchbacks, but all-in-all not bad even with a pack. Once we reached the top and we were met with an absolutely breathtaking 360-degree view at just under 8,000 feet. We stopped here for a while to rest, replenish and take it all in. It was so massive and mesmerizing I could barely breathe. If this could be bottled I'd call it \"soulshine.\" - mine did.\r From here the Albert Camp Tr #375 stretched out before us as far as we could see. It was relatively easy to navigate and no less striking than all that came before it, dipping back down to 5500 feet. At about 2/3 of the way on Albert Camp Tr #375 we passed through another burn area (or part of the 2006 one, not sure) but here the blackened remnants were surrounded with massive amounts of wildflowers, predominantly the red Indian Paintbrush. Magical. I kept saying it's like walking through a storybook. The entire Albert Camp Tr #375 is worth every single step, even the knee-pounding downhill switchbacks toward the end.\r Our Green Trails map showed that the first (and only) water source would be at Sunday Creek where Albert Camp Tr #375 meets Deer Park Tr #341 (where we thought we'd be able to camp for the night). We were beginning to think we'd missed a turn somewhere till we finally saw the sign nailed to a tree that read \"Iron Gate\". \r Deer Park Tr #341 - From this point it was 2 miles of pure hell for us. We missed where the trail went to Sunday Creek (before the Iron Gate sign) and we were beyond tired and low on water. By now we'd done a fairly grueling (but beautiful) 10.5 miles from Smith Lake. Yes, we know! Seriously, we're not reckless or irresponsible people. Valuable lessons learned, eh? The trail was narrow and wild for the most part, slopes and lots of wilderness debris -- no place to camp. No choice but to keep going. The trail went back up and at one point we couldn't find where it continued, thankfully a little zig-zagging and we did. If this was a day hike I'd say, \"Ok, this isn't bad, we're in the wilderness after all.\" Then came the blowdowns. Lots and lots and lots of blowdowns. To circumvent some you could climb up the side of the trail and around, but most of them not. You either had to climb over them or crawl under them. Some were precariously scary. Did I mention we both had 40+ lb backpacks? I'm ready to laugh in hindsight as I sit here writing this and looking at the photo of my partner crawling on his hands and knees. But really, it wasn't very funny at the time, not funny at all. \r About halfway in on Deer Park Tr #341 we hit what I believe was Deer Park Creek (according to the map). Water, precious water. We filled up and looked around for a place to camp, nothing. My thought was to just set up in the middle of the trail but that too was rocky and impossible. We decided to keep going back to Iron Gate Trailhead no matter what. Slow and steady. Over, under, around.\r We had left Smith Lake sometime around 10am that morning. The time stamp on my last photo is 6:28pm (still on Deer Park Tr #341). It was like in the movies when I edged ahead and finally saw the junction of Deer Park Tr #341 and Boundary Tr #533. I shouted, we're here! Only .7 miles more to the trailhead. Piece of cake. Slow and steady.\r I'm not exactly sure what time we made it back to the trailhead and our truck. The parking lot was full but we never saw another soul this entire day after embarking on the Albert Camp Tr #375. We drove back to Tonasket, WA and decided to get a room for the night and lucked out at the Red Apple Inn. Before checking out our room we thought we'd better find some real food. By now it was 9pm and the town was literally closed except for one of those quick stop marts. Ice cream and frozen pepperoni pizza was our best choice. We call the Red Apple Inn to ask if there was a microwave in our room. \"Yes, a nice white one.\" he said.\r So this adventure ends, for now. We can't wait to go back. Yes, you read that right. We decided to do the Pasayten Wilderness again (sans the Deer Park Tr #341). So many other trails to explore. We're planning on the end of September when the Larches are decked out in all their yellow glory. Have a great summer!", "date": "Jul 2, 2014"}, {"comment": "A long and lovely day in a loop from Iron Gate Trailhead, up the Boundary Trail (#533) to Sunny Pass, and then up the west slope of Horseshoe Mtn. to the summit (7935'), and then down the south ridge on the Albert Camp Trail (#375), which has to be one of the most beautiful and pleasurable hikes in the whole Pasaytens, to eventually join Deer Park trail (#341) and head west to join #533 again, and the short walk back to the trailhead. Total time just under 9 hours, 15 miles and over 2500' elevation gains.\r Lovely weather with wonderful views in all directions, and plenty of water, and only the occasional snow patch to cross up high. Our only complaint (besides the neglected 6 mile road in to Iron Gate) is the condition of the amazing Albert Camp trail in the Deer Park area, and the 2.5 mile trail #341 leading back to the west which had numerous blow downs, and showed neglect of at least a couple of years. These tails are worth walking just to keep them alive, but need a little TLC, especially if anyone expects to use a horse on them again.\r The day was so nice we just couldn't stop at Sunny Pass, and instead added on at least 5 miles and 1500' vertical gain on the return trip.

Having already done the Cathedral Pass Loop a few years ago and loving the remote, desolate area, we jumped on board.  We fully expected the same type of trip with open country and easy to follow, well maintained trails.  Boy were we in for a big surprise! \r Our loop was as follows:  Andrews Creek TR to Andrews Pass to Rock Lake to Peepsight Lake to Fawn Lake / Ashnola Pass to Black Lake out to Lake Creek TR.   (Our friends went north to Sheep Mtn on day 5 but came out the same way).\r 8/27 \u2013 Andrews Creek\r Started at Andrews Creek trailhead around 1pm.  Andrews Creek trail #504 was in good condition but very dusty and hot.  Some logs to step over.  The area was burned in 2003 so there was little shade and with our heavy packs we did not make it far.  Camped at Blizzard Creek junction just past the gauging station in what used to be a camp.  The buildings that were here are gone from the fire.  Easy access to the river for water.\r 8/28 \u2013 Andrews Creek to Rock Lake\r Continued up Andrews Creek trail #504.  The trail to Peepsight #525 at 5,300 elevation is gone.  The sign is still there but it is overgrown and has downed logs over it.  We continued up to Andrew Pass instead.  There is a large camp located near the pass with water access.  At the Pass we headed to Rock Lake on Peepsight #525 (North loop).  There is a new sign but the trail (I would call it more of a path) itself is faint and easy to lose.  We followed cairns and made our way up to Rock Lake to camp.  \r 8/29 \u2013 8/31  - Rock Lake\r We camped three nights at Rock Lake and climbed Andrew, Amos, Peepsight and Freds.  The \u201cpath\u201d up to Crazy Man Pass (#525) is in pretty good shape although faint and hard to follow in places.  We added a bunch of cairns to improve the route as we knew we\u2019d be headed out that way.\r 8/31  - Rock Lake to Peepsight Lake\r We parted ways with our friends who headed North via Glory Creek #503A and Spanish Creek #503 to climb Sheep Mountain while we headed out via Black Lake.\r We took the path up to Crazy Man Pass #525 then down the other side.  We followed cairns through the basin almost to the small pond at the head of Peepsight Creek.  At some point we got impatient and made a short cut straight up the slope (north) to the saddle above Peepsight Lake where we caught up with the trail leading up the left (west) side of the slope.  It\u2019s unclear if the trail indicated on the green trail/USGS map # 525A is still there on the east side as we did not see it.  A very large bear was sighted in the basin. Good thing he wasn\u2019t too curious of us.\r The trail down to Peepsight Lake from the saddle was easy to follow.  Peepsight Lake is absolutely beautiful.  Not much in the way of wildlife here and it feels remote and desolate.  There are several camps at Peepsight Lake.  \r 9/1 - Peepsight Lake to Fawn Lake/Ashnola Pass\r Left Peepsight Lake following cairns on the Ashnola River trail #525.1, shown as a dotted line trail on the green trail map (which the key should mark as \u201cgood luck!\u201d).  This trail is not being maintained.  Getting down to elev 6,500 was challenging.  There are many, many downed trees and the trail was very hard to follow.  Further down it improved so that it was visible but we had to climb over many, many downed trees.  The trail is actually on the south side of Ashnola River not the north side as shown on the Green Trail/USGS maps.  The junction with Lake Creek #500, elevation 5,800 (section marked as Spotted Creek on the Green Trail Map) was easy to find and it looks like there used to be a big horse camp. The entire area is buried under logs now.  \r We were hoping that once we got on Spotted Creek / Black Lake trail #500 to Ashnola Pass it would be easy going.  Unfortunately, we were dead wrong.  This trail is also not being maintained although it was easier to follow.  We made our way to Fawn Lake where we set up camp at Ashnola Pass.\r 9/2 \u2013 9/3 \u2013 Fawn Lake / Ashnola Pass to Lake Creek TR\r Lake Creek Trail #500 trail between Ashnola Pass and Black Lake is abandoned and impassable. The trail in most cases is buried under logs over logs.  We must have stepped over, crawled under, climbed on +1000 trees.  The bridges are smashed out under downed trees.  Good navigation skills or GPS essential to stay on / near the trail.  Fortunately, the trail shown on both Green Trail and USGS maps are accurate but should now be completely erased.\r The top section above 4,800 feet was very slow going, taking about 2 hours per mile.  At around 3:00pm on 9/2 we got weathered out by a rainstorm at 5,100 ft. and had to set up camp.  We were lucky to find a small clear spot big enough for our tent (though not flat) and had enough water in our bladders for dinner and breakfast.\r The next day the weather improved and we decided to break camp and make a \u201crun\u201d for it.  Below 4,800 ft. it got very slightly better - we could take about 5 steps on the trail (wow!) before hitting an obstruction.  We finally got to Black Lake in the late afternoon and decided to make a bee line for the car instead of camping there as had been or original intention.  Below Black Lake the trail is in great condition with only 4 trees to go over \u2013 a walk in the park!  Got to Lake Creek TH at 5:40pm.\r We would not recommend this route.\r Happy Hiking!", "date": "Aug 27, 2016"}, {"comment": "I just did a 6 night solo trip in the Pasayten (6/17/16- 6/23/16)\r This was my route:\r Andrew's Creek #504\rSpanish Creek #503 \rSouth on #500 toward Ashnola pass\rNorth on #532 & #502 toward Peeve Pass (Quartz lake side trip)\rRounding Sheep Mtn. #506 to Park pass\r#529 to the Boundary Trail #533\rFollowed the Boundary to Remmel Lk (#510)\rContinued on #510 (Chewuch R.) to #534 to connect to #360\rTook #360/#342 to Horseshoe Basin\rHere I connected back to the Boundary, heading west over Apex pass and Cathedral, and came back out the Andrew's creek trail. \r Everything is pretty much snow free. There were a couple small snow fields at Cathedral and Apex that required some careful step kicking, but I did it with my poles and hiking shoes just fine. \rI heard wolf howls on the other side of the lake at Remmel (!!!), literally just across the lake. That was amazing. I am guessing they are from the Hozomeen pack that straddles the border. The other closest pack is the loup loup, but they tend to reside near the towns of Twisp and Omak. The trail crew was out clearning the ever-falling blowdowns on Andrew's creek, which is pretty clear. I did not know what to expect after last years fire, and I was pleasantly surprised. \r The one section of trail that was messed up beyond belief was #503 (Spanish Creek) and the climb after crossing the Ashnola River (#500). It was like walking through a horizontal forest...hundreds of blowdowns for about 6 miles.  Other than that, it was pretty smooth sailing the whole route.", "date": "Jun 17, 2016"}, {"comment": "My long time goal was to hike a large portion of the Boundary Trail in the Pasayten wilderness (described by Mike Woodmansee in his book on Backpacking Washington). I finally settled on a plan to start from the Andrews Creek Trailhead and hike some 85 miles to Hart's Pass via Boundary Trail and PCT. Thanks to Classic Mountain Cabby I could arrange for a shuttle so that I could park my car at Hart's Pass and be shuttled to Andrews Creek. I started hiking solo on Aug 25 planning on a 5 or 6 day backpack.\rIt was a cloudy day suitable for a gradual, 3500 foot ascent along the heavily burnt creek drainage to the Boundary trail at Spanish camp. The next 2 days were glorious hiking along the Boundary trail with stunning vistas of the high peaks of the Pasayten and the parkland vistas of meadows interspersed with Alpine tundra and tree vegetation. Plenty of flowing water. Did not see a single person after the trailhead. A spectacular second night campsite at Peeve Pass with extensive views east was memorable followed the next day by a complex up and down traverse to Bunker Hill which offers 360 degrees view of the wilderness less than a mile from the Canadian border.\rAfter this is a long, deep plunge to the Pasayten river at the junction of the Pasayten and its East Fork. This again is through a highly burnt drainage where the trail seems to be in indifferent shape but helped by rock cairns. Towards the end of the third day I ended up close to the expected junction of the Boundary Trail and the East Fork Pasayten River trail (#477). Unfortunately at this point I could not locate this junction at all. I managed to find trail 477 but just could not find the Boundary trail continuation which leads across the East Fork and the Pasayten apparently on bridges! Very disappointed I decided not to bushwhack and search anymore but instead hike out to the Billy Goat trailhead via the East Fork trail. This was a pleasant day and half of hiking with a chance to visit the incredible and interesting Hidden lakes (the Big lake is 2 miles long and few hundred feet wide in a glacier carved valley) and views of Many Trails Peak and other peaks on the way to Lucky Pass and the trailhead. \rMy question is whether anyone has hiked the Boundary Trail and either located this junction and continued on the traverse or like me been foiled by this. The forest service did tell me before the hike that the trail was not maintained beyond Bunker Hill but did not tell me anything about the difficulty of locating the trail at the Pasayten. Hence very curious.", "date": "Aug 24, 2014"}, {"comment": "", "date": "Aug 23, 2013"}],

"comments":[{"comment": "A beautiful, remote hike through the Pasayten! We hiked the entire length of the Hidden Lakes trail (#477), from the Billy Goat trailhead to the southern end of Big Hidden Lake, where the trail ends. The whole trail is about 20 miles each way (40 total). Since there isn\u2019t much information available regarding this trail, I\u2019ll go into detail on each aspect of it.ROAD: Eightmile Creek Road (FS Rd 5130) is paved most of the way; it turns to gravel 11 miles before the Billy Goat trailhead. There are potholes on both the paved section and the gravel section of road, so be vigilant. We drove slowly but surely and our Mini Cooper made it just fine. The previous trip report mentioned that an avalanche had covered the road near the trailhead, but it has since melted and the road is passable all the way to the trailhead.CAR CAMPING: There are four campgrounds along Eightmile Creek Road, all run by the National Forest. Although all of them would be good places to camp the night before/after your trip, the Ruffed Grouse Campground (second-closest to the trailhead) is your best bet. It\u2019s the only campground that currently offers potable water, which is even cold and tastes great. Nice Campground (further from the trailhead) has a water pump too, but it\u2019s out of order.TRAIL NAVIGATION: The Green Trails map was last revised in 1997 and things have definitely changed over the last 20 years.First, the map shows two options for climbing the slope between the Drake River and Lucky Pass: a 1.4-mile route and a 2-mile route. In reality, only the 1.4-mile route exists. There\u2019s no trace of the 2-mile route anymore.Second, the map contradicts itself regarding the distance between Lucky Pass and Cougar Lake. The distance labels say it\u2019s 7.5 miles, but according to our GPS this distance was over 9 miles. It certainly felt more like 9 miles. If you use the map\u2019s scale to measure out each mile between these two points, it IS about 9 miles; however, the map\u2019s distance labels of 3.8, 1.8, and 1.9 between the two points are incorrect and add up to 7.5 miles.Finally, if you hike the Hidden Lakes trail from south to north, starting from the Billy Goat trailhead like we did, the trail stops at the southern end of Big Hidden Lake. That\u2019s the extent of the hikeable trail in its current state. Although the Green Trails map says the trail continues north along the east bank of Big Hidden Lake and beyond, this is no longer true. It ends between the Tatoosh Buttes trail (#485) and the southern end of Big Hidden Lake, where it peters out. (I suppose it may be possible to hike the northern end of the Hidden Lakes Trail starting from the Boundary Trail (#533) near the Pasayten River and heading south, but I don\u2019t know what conditions are like up there. Either way you approach it, the Hidden Lakes trail is an out-and-back route, no longer a through-route.)As noted, the Hidden Lakes trail ends north of the junction with the Tatoosh Buttes trail, so fortunately the Buttes trail is still accessible. I don\u2019t know what conditions on the Buttes trail are like, but we encountered another hiker who explored that trail and successfully reached the Buttes at the top.TRAIL CONDITIONS: The trail is very dry and dusty, except for a few mudholes here and there. Most of the trail is exposed and sunny (i.e., very hot), so be sure to drink plenty of water. It starts getting a little brushy just north of First Hidden Lake and the cabin, and starts getting very brushy right after the north end of Middle Hidden Lake. \u00a0If it\u2019s at all windy, be wary of falling trees. As we passed Middle Hidden Lake we heard about 6 trees fall, and the wind wasn\u2019t even very strong. Forest fires have left a lot of standing dead trees here.The wildflower display is amazing right now! Beware of mosquitoes, especially between the trailhead and Hoot Owl Camp. We used head nets and slathered on the DEET but still got quite a few bites. This is a lightly-traveled trail -- we encountered about 12 other people over the course of 5 days, and this was during a long holiday weekend.FOOD STORAGE: There are no food storage instructions on the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest website or the bulletin board at the trailhead, so we played it safe and used a bear canister -- and that seems to be the only viable option. The campsites don\u2019t have bear poles/wires/boxes. Also, most of the trees in this area have very short branches, so you can\u2019t count on finding a tree with a branch that\u2019s 15\u2019 above the ground and allows you to hang your food a safe distance from the trunk (some recommend at least 5\u2019 while others say 8\u2019).CAMPING: Although junctions are generally signed well, campsites are not. The Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest website doesn\u2019t offer any information regarding campsites along the trail, so we had to rely on previous trip reports for that information. We used our GPS to note the locations of all the campsites we saw, and here\u2019s the full list:Just after the trailhead (under \u00bc mile) \u2013 Camp3 miles \u2013 Camp4 miles \u2013 Camp5 miles (Drake River Camp) \u2013 Large camping area that could hold multiple tents7.8 miles (Hoot Owl Camp) \u2013 One tent site, another right along the trail, and two larger sites approx. one mile further west17 miles (Cougar Lake Camp) \u2013 Large camping area (for multiple tents) just off the trail, plus a smaller site downhill beside the outlet stream22.8 miles (Hidden Lakes Camp) \u2013 A complex that includes an old cabin from the 1950s (locked), a large hiker camp that could hold multiple tents (which includes a shelter), and a couple horse camp areas. One of the horse camps is now inaccessible due to two fallen trees blocking the path to the camp. (Remember how we heard those 6 trees falling earlier? Well, 2 of them fell right across the path to the horse camp!) Fortunately that isn\u2019t the only horse camp at Hidden Lakes -- there\u2019s at least one other spot that looks like a horse camp, right by the cabin.", "date": "Jun 30, 2017"}, {"comment": "\u00a0 Brief account of a 4-night backpack to Big Hidden Lake with side trip to Tatoosh Buttes. \u00a0One small patch of snow on Eightmile Creek Road very close to the end, but it was gone by the end of our trip.\u00a0 Trail 477 is pretty much completely clear as far as the intersection with Tatoosh Buttes trail. The trail is heavily eroded, and very dusty (or possibly muddy) thanks to the pack animal use. \u00a0It could really use some trail work (water bars etc.); or fewer heavy animals tearing it up. \u00a0The trail also goes through recently burned forest beyond First Hidden Lake, so logs will be falling in the future.\u00a0 The trail between Middle and Big Hidden Lakes is pretty wet and has become a streambed in some places. \u00a0Beyond Tatoosh Buttes trail there are a lot of burned logs down across the trail. \u00a0Nothing impassable, but certainly slows you down. \u00a0Middle and Big Hidden Lakes seem a bit murky - possibly from sedimentation or fertilization post-fire?\u00a0\u00a0 We hiked past Tatoosh Buttes trail perhaps a half-mile to a campsite on Big HIdden Lake, with lots of down trees around. \u00a0Saw some otters and loons on the lake, as well as hearing nighthawks and owls. \u00a0Also had bad mosquitoes one night (but not the other), and black flies.\u00a0 Went for a day hike up Tatoosh Buttes trail to the Buttes. \u00a0Lots of flowers all the way up. \u00a0Maybe 30-40 trees down across the trail. \u00a0Most are just a step-over, some require a little off-trail scrambling. \u00a0Several streams flowing. \u00a0Some very small snow patches were on the trail just before cresting out on the buttes, and some snow patches in heavily drifted areas up there. \u00a0Trail in decent shape except for down trees.\u00a0\u00a0Not a whole lot of camping along the Hidden Lakes, but one campsite at east end Cougar Lake, 2 cabins and a shelter between First and Middle, and the small campsite on Big Hidden that I stayed at.\u00a0", "date": "Jun 29, 2017"}, {"comment": "**The second to last curve of the forest road to the trailhead is covered with deepish remaining snow from an avalanche. This means you can't drive all the way to that trailhead, limiting the amount of parking and requiring around 1/4 mile walking and maybe 100 feet elevation gain. This was the only snow before or during the trail.I went with my fiance and few friends to explore the Paseyten Wilderness. With all the snow on the Western slopes, we figured we would try the Eastern cascades. Camped near the trailhead (Billy Goat Trailhead) Friday night and started our one night backpack Saturday morning. We had to park a bit from the trailhead due to the reason above.We hiked trail #477 over the 5900 foot Lucky Pass to Hoot Owl Camp. It's about 7 miles into the trail and a great camp. The trail was in general great condition, even with the approximately two dozen fallen trees to step/climb over or go around. We had attempted the Three Fools Pass trail (branches off #477, and also goes to Larch Pass) but quickly ran into seemingly endless downed trees and a very difficult/impossible to follow trail. Don't count on that trail being passable until the WTA crew clears it. So back to #477. We stopped at the above mentioned campsite and didn't continue the 7 miles, 1500 feet down to the beginning of the Hidden Lakes. But, according to the only other people we saw, the remaining trail is fine. Completely snow free and easy to follow. Overall, a very beautiful, empty, and pristine area. Great solitude.", "date": "Jun 17, 2017"}, {"comment": "We started at the Robinson Creek Trailhead mid-day with the plan of reaching a site we\u2019d camped at before, about 7.5-8 miles from the TH in a lovely meadow with a big rock to sit on with enough food for a 9 day trip, not sure where we\u2019d go but we would have options. Trail had obviously had more traffic than on Memorial Day weekend when we were there last- blowdown trees we\u2019d bushwhacked to get around now had bypass trails. Lots of brush starting around mile 3 and lasting until the ford of Robinson Creek, which was about mid-calf deep.  Our campsite has a very friendly deer that grazed close to us while her two fawns stayed a safe distance away.  The number of blowdowns along this trail to Robinson Pass is annoying but not terrible\u2026 There\u2019s a campsite near the Slate Pass junction that has water. \r Robinson Pass is lovely! To camp there you\u2019d need to carry water from the Slate Pass junction or head north of the Pass for a stream. The trickles we found there were muddy.  Trail here was in great condition! We saw baby grouse learning to fly and their fiercely protective mother ran us away in the other direction with a loud display. Adorable. More campsites at the second junction for Slate Peak in a meadow- looks like lots of campsite options and water there. We could see that blowdowns had been freshly cut in this area along with two backpacks, some tools and a thing we thought was for carrying logs. At this point the trail started to devolve into a mess of blowdowns. We met a hiker who told us the blowdowns were really terrible. He\u2019d camped at Tatoosh Buttes and still-snowy, Lake Doris. We thought he said he\u2019d come via Hidden Lakes and Shellrock Pass to get to Lake Doris in a big loop to avoid the blowdowns 2x, hmm\u2026 We continued through the blowdowns and next  we met the two FS men who were there to clear the trail, oh man do they have their work cut out for them \uf04c They said they had been working for two days and it looked like they might have cleared \u00bc to \u00bd a mile of trail. We do not believe it is an overestimation that there are well over 100 blowdowns per mile, and likely significantly more between here and the ford of the Pasayten River near the junction with Buckskin Ridge, about 9 miles away.  Every kind of blowdown: big, small, multiple trees, across the trail, along the trail. We ended up with the crotch fully ripping out in his pants (thanks OR for giving us a new pair today!) and I with two black and blue legs covered in bruises. \r By now we\u2019d covered over 10 miles, 5 of it very difficult. Lots of bear signs, including some of the biggest fresh claw marks we\u2019ve ever seen on a tree. Very important to practice bear safety here. I put the bear spray on my hip belt. We camped just beyond the junction to Lake Doris/Shellrock Pass near the noisy stream. The campsites here are small and fit our 2 person tent but don\u2019t think anything bigger would work here. We decided to try for a long day to Tatoosh Buttes and camp there. \r The next morning we continued traipsing over, under and around the blowdowns for another 5 agonizingly slow miles. Maybe a mile an hour and we normally hike 3mph in terrain like this, even with our 50+ lb packs. At the junction near the Pasayten River ford we found an old falling-apart handwritten FS sign stating that the trail ahead was impassible to stock due to a landslide and lots of trees down. We could see lots of trees down. We were tired of blowdowns so we decided to take the detour and ford the river, which was about knee deep. The trail beyond the river was downright pleasant compared to what we\u2019d been doing- occasional blowdowns, not brushy, etc. The forest was alive with the sounds of animals and trees creaking in the increasing wind. We reached the junction where you can continue straight on to the Pasayten Airfield but passed on the 2 mile detour this time and turned right. Here too is a sign stating that there is a landslide and the trail is impassible to stock. Hmm. So the detour for stock is also impassible to stock? This sign would be helpful at the first detour location. It is quite the landslide! The whole trail is missing on a very steep section and many trees have fallen into the river. We were able to easily get above it but it was not easy to descend back on to the trail. I took off my pack and lowered it to the trail before taking a controlled 3 foot feet first dirt slide to the trail- cautious because if I\u2019d slipped too far would mean falling quite a distance, possibly into the river. It looks like there should be a bridge here anchored on two large rocks but no bridge was in evidence. The water was deep and we could hear the rocks moving in the strong current. I think a ford here would be thigh deep in the shallowest sections. We found a two-tree collection to slide across with some difficulty- you either have to change trees mid-river or stay on one tree that ends a foot or two before you reach the other side of the river. Not for the timid, which I count myself as. \r The Tatoosh Buttes trail starts off in lovely forest alive with low underbrush and the sounds of birds. We had another tricky log crossing at Lease Creek, but a ford here wouldn\u2019t be deep if you wanted to take the time to deal with it.  We passed a marked junction for Lease Lakes\u2014but there is definitely no trail there\u2014just the signs. The trail gets very steep to the Buttes and the wind was viciously cold as the clouds grew dark and drizzly. We put on our raingear to block the wind first and secondly for the very light drizzle. Once on the ridgelines the trail gains and loses elevation through meadows and burned tree ghosts. It\u2019s lovely.  More mother grouse and babies. It\u2019s definitely baby season in the mountains! We were tired and didn\u2019t realize we\u2019d reached the buttes- having been eyeing the ridgeline towards Ptarmigan Mountain and mistaking it for the buttes along the way. We ended up camping on Tamarack Ridge in a meadow. There was a little trickle of water below the tallest Butte and another on the way to Tamarack Ridge but we don\u2019t know how long there will be water here for camping. This is a stunning, starkly beautiful place. Wow. The wind is bitingly cold and we put on all our warm layers, grateful we had a 15f double sleeping bag to snuggle up in.  We had brought microspikes, considering going over Ptarmigan and Dot mountain and back via the Col west of Lago... but from afar we could see that was clearly ice axe terrain. The small patches of snow at our elevation were very hard and it seemed likely we'd need crampons for that traverse right now. Boo. \r We *really* didn\u2019t want to go back through the 1000+ blowdowns,  especially as we were already down one person\u2019s pants (he was now hiking in sweaty hot rain pants that had a new tear in them). Despite all the joking about hiking without pants being the *new ultralight thing*, we really didn\u2019t want to do that and it would be painful. I repaired the pants a second time that evening (the repair had ripped out rather quickly that morning), hoping they might hold if we had to hike out through the blowdown town. The rangers had suggested we hike out via Hidden Lakes since it was freshly logged out! And we *thought* the one hiker we met said he had come via Shellrock Pass on the Monument Creek trail. It was marked on the green trails map as a dotted line, which in other areas usually means a passable trail (haha, not in the Pasayten!).  We decided to head for Shellrock Pass after spending the night at Hidden Lakes. \r The next morning it alternated between bitterly cold wind and snow and sunshine, finally settling upon bitterly cold wind and snow showers. We went to the ridge of Ptarmigan Peak and looked down at Ptarmigan Lake and the Tamarack valley. We could hear wolf cubs yipping in the breeze, sounding fairly close by. The snow turned to rain as we descended towards Hidden Lakes. There were maybe a dozen annoying blowdowns to contend with. A couple of small streams for water. Then we found freshly cleared trail about a mile from the lakes- heavenly! It\u2019s brushy in places but otherwise totally clear. The Hidden Lakes weren\u2019t visible until we were upon them, true to name. I wanted to find the Monument Creek trail for the next morning so we continued past the lakes for a while\u2026 never seeing a junction.  If the Lease Lakes trail wasn\u2019t on the map and had signs, shouldn\u2019t a trail on the map have a sign?! We pulled out the map and GPS and returned to the south end of the last lake where the trail should be. The talus is arranged like an old junction and the rocks made a neat crossing, like a trail should be there. But no trail. We bushwhacked a little through very thick underbrush, finding some old cut blowdowns\u2014this must have been the trail. Trail is no more. I cried, knowing we either had to go back the way we came or hike out to a different TH and figure out a way to get the 50 miles back to our car. We backtracked to the Hidden Lakes to think and camped at a major camp area with two outbuildings and a nice stream for water. There was an occupied tent near the hiker campsite- we walked right by and talked in case they would pop out and have information for us, or maybe even offer us a ride the next day? Maybe they were sleeping \uf04c  It rained but was pleasantly warm compared to Tatoosh Buttes. Things were not sounding good for us right now. No pants. Covered in bruises. On the plus side we still had 4 days left of food and more if we ate sparingly so we did have options. \r This was the first time we\u2019d ever wanted to use the satellite phone we carry for emergencies in the backcountry. We texted out and asked a friend if there was any taxi service in Mazama or Winthrop. Two hours later a message came back. Yes. Mountain Transport and here was their phone number. We contacted Mountain Transport and were told they usually want 2-3 days notice. We said we\u2019d try them back in a couple hours in case they changed their minds. We resolved that we\u2019d be going out via Billy Goat TH even if they said no- at the worst we camp at the TH until we can hitch a ride. On our second call, Mountain Transport agreed to get us at the Billy Goat TH (horse lot) at 3pm the next day for $279. We decided that was worth it to us and gave them our CC information to reserve the pickup.  That TH was 16 miles from where we were camped and an extra mile to the horse lot.  \r We were on the trail before 7am, knowing we\u2019d have to hike steadily and quickly to make it there on time. We made good time and were 5 miles on our way by 9:15am. We took a break near Diamond Creek after crossing a REAL BRIDGE (not the ford I\u2019d been anticipating) and enjoyed a snack.  The trail steadily climbs from here but never really steep. We moved slowly, wanting to conserve energy. About halfway to Lucky Pass is a pretty meadow area with a nearby trickle of water that could be a nice camp. We passed one party of two carrying an uncomfortable looking raft headed to Hidden Lakes. I\u2019d put that thing in a pack for a 16 mile hike! This made 3 hikers, 2 FS employees as our human total in 5 days. Almost to the pass is a pretty rocky outcrop. All along the way are amazing views of the surrounding peaks, Many Trails (which has no trails on the map, ha!), Three Pinnacles, Rampart Ridge. We took a longer 15 minute break to dry out our feet and enjoy the sunny weather- it was only 11:30am. Go us!\r Lucky Pass doesn\u2019t appear to have anywhere to camp. Lots of trees down and no water. We descended a steep rocky dry path for a while- no sign of the single long switchback on our GPS (marked on the map as a 2 mile alternate route). Many blowdowns had been cut- looks like this would have been very unpleasant before the log-out. The trail descends to cross Drake Creek on a bridge just after a junction stating that the Billy Goat TH was 4 miles ahead and a left turn towards Larch Creek (and Hidden Lakes 12 miles the other way). We were getting tired but 4 miles sounded manageable. The bugs were really bad in this section. I wear clothes treated in permetherin so they mostly avoided me but my sweetie was eaten alive. There were annoying bugs everywhere else along the trail besides Tatoosh Buttes but this area is by far the worst.  We hadn\u2019t read the map carefully\u2014another 1,000 foot gain to Eightmile Pass before the descent to the TH. This felt like a really long 4 miles to the gate at the road, followed by another mile to the horse lot. We arrived at 2:30pm with very tired feet and 1 minute later- the taxi showed up. The driver told us all about the area and his adventures on the 1.5 hour, 50 mile ride back to our car at Robinson Creek TH. FYI: should you ever have to hike out another trailhead in an unplanned fashion in the general area, the cabbie recommended that you make your way to a campground as they are regularly checked by FS employees, even in remote areas like FS Road 5130. The FS employees can radio out to call you a mighty expensive cab ride like ours, or you might find people willing to give you a ride! (I always carry $100 emergency cash in my 10 essentials for a scenario like this)\r Boy, this was long! Our route  58+ miles, 12500 elevation gain and 10500 loss over 5 difficult days. I think once the Pasayten River section is logged out this hike will be much easier \uf04a The FS guys said it was a priority because Slate Pass road will be opening soon. I\u2019d check with the Rangers before heading out unless you enjoy this sort of adventure!", "date": "Jul 2, 2016"}, {"comment": "We walked a 40 mile loop in the Pasayten over 5 days. Started and ended at the Billy Goat Trailhead. Went over Larch Pass (larches are golden now), down into McCall Gulch (lots of bear and coyote scat) and west along the East Fork Pasayten River Trail. It was near freezing and dusting of snow on a few passes but overall nice temps for backpacking at lower elevevations.\r I'm posting this trip report mainly to let people know that the East Fork Pasayten River trail (#451) from the Dollar Watch spur to Hidden Lakes junction (eastward) and southward all along Big Hidden Lake (Hidden Lakes trail) is quite difficult to walk. Last trip report of this trail (in August) listed a hundred trees down. I'm guessing after the big northwest windstorm a month ago a bunch more came down because over a 7 mile stretch there are more like over 200 blowdowns (maybe more?). Most are stepovers but some require reroutes through very thick new growth (see picture). It's very slow going and there are few suitable places to camp on this stretch (and fewer trees to hang a bear bag) and we could clearly tell this is primarily a game trail right now (bear, coyote, deer, elk). \r There are 2 streams at the north end of Big Hidden Lake that require either fording or a very tricky log crossing (with poles).\r Okanagan National Forest web site lists this trail as not having been cleared in the last 4 years. The blowdowns cease (southward) at the Tatoosh Buttes trail connection (there's a temp yellow paper sign) where stock users have kept the trail clear. \r Other than that all the other trails are in great shape. The campground at the south end of Cougar Lake along the outlet is exceptional.", "date": "Sep 16, 2015"}],

And to spend one of our three nights with three pack goats was an extra bonus!\r Day One: Emiko, John, Julianne, Kari, Beth, Jared and I started our July 4 weekend adventure at the PCT stock trailhead just below Slate Pass (snow on the road stopped us there).  Starting at 9:30 am, we hiked the road to the Slate Pass trailhead and looked down at the spectacular snow-filled (but quickly melting) basin.  We crossed the basin and easily found the Middle Fork Pasayten trail.  We continued to drop to the river (2000 feet!) and then followed the trail north until it crossed the river.  The crossing was not difficult (poles and water shoes were handy) and we enjoyed a snack by the river. And then we just continued north until we arrived at our junction - and the start of our 2000 elevation gain - to Fred's Lake and then to Doris Lake.  We encountered snow between Fred's and Doris which required some route-finding skills but then arrived at the sparkling Doris Lake at 6:30.  \r Doris is really special - larches abound and the views up valley to Shellrock Pass, down valley to Goat Peak Lookout are lovely. And to cap it all off, we were warmly greeted by our friend Perry and his three pack goats!  We enjoyed a leisurely dinner together sharing stories until long past sunset!\r Day Two: We arose early and discussed plans for the day.  Four of us scrambled Osceola Peak, two headed back to Slate Pass, one explored the lake, and Perry and his goats continued their journey to Shellrock Pass. Osceola was great fun!  The scramble to the top looks challenging from the lake, but ends up being straight-forward over talus and boulders.  And the view from the summit - incredible!  We returned to camp, \"swam\" in the icy lake, read, and spend the rest of the day enjoying camp.  \r Day Three:  We had decided that our plans to scramble Lago and Carru were not to be so we came up with a wonderful Plan B.  We packed up and headed back down to the Middle Fork of the Pasayten to the Wildcat trail.  We met a Wilderness Ranger who confirmed that the trail was in good shape and that no one was there!  So we again gained 1300 feet to arrive at another gem: Lake Ferguson!  The lake is in a cirque and as we ate dinner, we watched as fish rose and the sun set.  Quiet, peaceful, beautiful!\r Day Four: Three of us decided to explore Wildcat Peak - leaving the camp and heading up the gentle ridge east of camp.  We followed a faint boot track for one hour and it took us directly to the summit!  More views!  From there, the north summit called, so followed the ridge line to the col, negotiating some craggy spots, and then continued along the steep ridge to our second high point of the day.  Oh my!  So nice!  And then down the scree back to camp where Jared had packed up all our gear and where Emiko had homemade hot chocolate waiting!  At 11, we started our journey back home, back across the river, and back up the (now almost melted and flower-filled!) basin to Slate Pass - arriving back at the car at 3:30.\r As for local treats, we started our adventure at the Winthrop Brewery enjoying terrific hamburgers and beer and ended at the Mazama Store for their superb pastries and salads.\r Sincere thanks to Morgan and his Forest Service crew for outstanding early-season work on the trails - they were in excellent condition!", "date": "Jul 3, 2014"}, {"comment": "", "date": "Sep 18, 2013"}, {"comment": "", "date": "Aug 8, 2011"}, {"comment": "", "date": "Aug 29, 2009"}],

Much of the trail is snow covered and the only tracks we saw were animals.The first part of the trail has some intermittent snow but once you get close to Lake Dorothy, the snow starts getting thicker - maybe 6-12 inches. As no one has apparently travelled this route since the snow fell, it was pretty soft and slow going. Microspikes would not be helpful as it was not icy.

There's no real path but you'll see some trampling that suggests that others have walked this way. Once you reach the power lines and turn left, you have to bushwhack for a few hundred feet more, and this is the trickiest part due to some thorny plants.

There were less than 10 cars in parking lot. Once we reached the Bridal Veil Falls, we had the place to ourselves! It was my first time up there, and it was beautiful - falls were gushing with water and there was mist in the air. Take time and enjoy the views!Then we backtracked 1/2 mile back to the trail and started the ascent for the Lake Serene. We passed two or three other small groups. Not that many people out at 9am, so it was perfect!The snow starts at around 2,300ft, about 1/4 mile from the end of the trail. It is intermittent and considerably easy to cross, just slow down, as the boardwalks are slippery! The snow was packed down, and even though I had gaiters and microspikes in my pack, I did not need to use them. (Be careful on the way down, walking down the steps can be icy - I actually slided down on my butt as I thought that to be the safest way to descent those few steps.)When we got to the Lake Serene at around 10am, it was beautiful! But it was much colder and super windy. Had a quick snack, water and started heading back down.About half a mile from the top (on our way down) we started seeing large groups of people, many dogs, and more groups of people. Because we were on our way down, they had the right of way, so our descent involved lots of stopping and letting people pass on their way up. It was way too many people to my liking, people of all abilities. But be aware that this trail is not kid friendly, as it is steep. I saw some people brought their snowshoes, but these were not necessary as the snow was packed down, and just in the final stretch of the hike.Get ready to cross numerous streams along the way, so if possible, wear waterproof shoes, or get ready to get wet. The more the snow melts, the more water will be present along the trail.Total moving time: 3hrs 45min // Distance: 8 miles round trip // Parking lots were full as we returned at noon.My route stats and more pictures at: https://www.gaiagps.com/datasummary/track/7199688ee7debbe7c1f2031567e963fa/", "date": "Jan 14, 2018"}],

There were reasonably-sized potholes on way\u00a0down, but of more concern were the deepening channels crossing the road - much deeper and my brave Buick would have had a challenge - things were getting pretty juicy.SO - I settled on Heather Lake. As expected, it was rather wet and muddy, and definitely not the beginners hike it typically is. Stream crossings were overflowing, taking over sections of the trail at times, and for a good part of the hike water flowed directly down the path. The snow line was abrupt just above 2000ft, and there were a 2-3in of slush/snow at the lake itself. Fun and beautiful, but even with waterproof gear I was impressively soaked by the time I made it back to the car.\u00a0", "date": "Nov 26, 2017"}],

Mileage for the main trail loop is only about a mile and a half, but there are bunches of side trails, gravel bars along the river, etc to explore that add mileage.   You can also walk back to the parking lot through old downtown Monroe along Lewis St or make a bigger loop going down main and cutting back through the Skykomish River Centennial Park.  My total mileage around the park, southwest through downtown and back around through Skykomish River Centennial Park was about 5 miles.  \r The forest is mainly deciduous, poplar, big leaf maple, etc and home to quite a diverse bird population.  The park can flood during the winter and the trails show evidence of silt buildup.  There are some really interesting railroad relics in the park - bits and pieces of what once was the longest covered railroad bridge in the world originally constructed by the Everett & Cherry Valley Traction Company Railway to cross the Skykomish river and provide rail service down to what is now Carnation.  If you are a little adventurous you can walk the old grade north all the way to the northern parking area just off Simons Rd, (don't venture out on the collapsing trestle over Woods Creek back to the BNSF mainline - highly dangerous.)

I'm not sure how accurate this app is though.", "date": "Aug 5, 2016"}, {"comment": "Our trip report is similar to the two earlier ones dated Jul 3, 2016 by bmachale which includes the very useful map you can also download from http://sjclandbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/WatmoughBay_map_REVISED_4_2016.pdf.  We had done a similar loop two years ago shortly after the area became part of the San Juan Island National Monument in 2013 (see http://www.blm.gov/or/resources/recreation/sanjuans/).  Again, we combined the loop up Chadwick Hill with the trail to Colville Point. We parked at the Watmough Bay parking lot off Watmough Head Road which has a bulletin board and a vault toilet.  From the north end of the beach a trail to Chadwick Hill starts behind the driftwood logs.  The map shows two trails leading up to Chadwick Hill, but the first one is not very distinct and may involve exposed scrambling.  The second trail, the one we preferred, branches off from the loop trail around the marsh that leads back to the parking lot.  For a short stretch this trail crosses private property (so marked) but apparently the trespassing is tolerated.  The trail has two short rocky sections where you will need feet and hands to grab a hold and steady yourself.  The trail crosses madrona tree covered cliffs and the views get better with every step.  At one of the viewpoints, someone laid out a circle of rocks (\"Stonehenge II\").  The rope swing is still there and is an endless source of enjoyment, even for old folks like us.  We use to do the loop counterclockwise and take the less steep trail down.  However, the upper entrance of the trail down is hard to find, in particular if you first follow the stub trail NE to the Mt. Baker view point.  The trail past the Mt. Baker view point peters out in bushes and becomes impassable. The loop trail down to the hay field and the road starts just behind the rope swing.  This time we also explored the unmarked side (or outer loop) trail north leading to the edge of private property by a fence corner, but it seemed less attractive and we turned around and we lost 150 feet elevation on this exploration that we had to regain on the way home.  The main trail down goes through mixed forest and past lichen-covered glacier-polished rocks.  Shortly before reaching the metal gate, a new sign points toward MARSH TRAIL (not explored yet) and there was an indication of recent trail maintenance.  The main trail paralells the edge of a hay field and meets Watmough Head Road by a rope strung across the entry to the field that prevents vehicle entry. Walking 1/2 mile on the paved road back to the parking lot is no fun, but sometimes easier than the steep trail down. \rOnce back at the parking lot and picking up fresh supplies (water and food) from our parked car, the second part of the hike took us back down to Watmough Bay, this time taking a trail through the bushes at the south end of the bay.  We did not see a dead-end branch trail to the right shown on the map, but continued toward Watmough Head and took a short spur trail to the edge of the water with a nice view across the bay and the impressive cliffs below Chadwick Hill. The main trail climbs gently to the ridge, under a power line, follows the power line for a short distance, then drops to the unpaved section of Watmough Head Road where there is parking for only a few cars.  On the opposite side of the road, past a bicycle rack, the trail enters the Point Colville Reserve and soon splits.  You can take either branch of the trail, it is a loop and it will take you back to the Y.  The walk along the lichen-covered rock ledges with spectacular views of Colville Island and Castle Island is one of the most beautiful parts of Lopez Island.  The public land ends at a sign and a barbed wire fence. It is very difficult to get down to the edge of the water, the cliffs are too steep and slippery. \r P.S.: Earlier (Jul 3, 2016) references by other hikers about a connecting trail to Blackie Brady Park appear to be in error.  Blackie Brady County Park is on Hughes Bay!", "date": "Jul 27, 2016"}, {"comment": "We hiked the Chadwick Hill trail from the trailhead at Watmough Head Road (small pullout + rope gate). The trail proper starts at a well-signed gate reached after an ~1/4-mile walk along the margins of a field (see photo above). After this, signage is mostly non-existent, so bring a map & compass (which you should bring anyway, right? =). There are numerous unsigned trail junctions, so bear on a southeasterly course to reach Chadwick Hill and/or views of Watmough Bay.\r The trail passes through classic winter temperate rainforest, with a quiet, primeval vibe.

The trail gently ascends through the forest until reaching the crest of a ridge, heading east to Chadwick Hill proper, with sharp drop to Watmough Bay to south. Watch out for slippery rocks, especially on misty days.\r You can descend the way you came, or take a trail (we never found it) down to the beach at Watmough Bay/Blackie Brady County Park. You can turn this hike into a much longer loop by: a) parking at the Watmough Head Road trailhead; b) walking along Watmough Head Road to Point Colville; c) hiking north up  and over to Watmough Bay/Blackie Brady CP; d) ascending the north flank of Watmough Bay to Chadwick Hill and back to where you parked at the roped pullout.\r This is a great short hike on Lopez, whether on a clear day or an overcast day. Each has its charms.", "date": "Jan 25, 2016"}, {"comment": "Started out at 10:30am from an empty parking lot. Headed to the beach, then looped back and followed the trail past the \"leaving public lands\" sign up to the ridge. The map from the San Juan County Land bank site showed a second route to the top, but that would have required some scrambling, as far as we could tell. Even so, there were two short, rocky sections that required some care. Once on top, the trail was very pleasant, and the views as advertised.\r Encountered only one other party on the trail, though the parking lot was full when we got back.", "date": "Feb 15, 2015"}, {"comment": "", "date": "Apr 26, 2014"}],

One good use of hiking poles is to lift the bushes so you can see the trail and not injure yourself!\u00a0 Then there was quite a long distance on talus,about 45 min. for us,\u00a0 in the open sun of course. The river was right below us- maybe 20 feet but the trail was built up on the talus so we would have to crawl down the rock wall and beat thru very thick bushes. maybe o.k. if there was not a warning about rattlesnakes.\u00a0 We lost interest and quit just before the end.", "date": "Jun 22, 2017"}, {"comment": "Hiked up the Monument Creek trail until the bridge washout at Eureka Creek, and spent the night on a gravel bar beside the Lost River.  The trail is in good condition.  After the first mile or so, it becomes crowded with brush, but the trail gets enough boot traffic that it isn't hard to stay on top of it.  When it is wet out, the brush that is encroaching on the trail would probably cause one to become soaked.  I turned around at Eureka Creek.  There are a couple of nice campsites near here, but the hike down to the Lost River is steep, so if you are planning on spending a night, you should prepare to hike the 4 miles in to these spots, or prepare for a difficult descent to the flat spots near the Lost River floodplain.", "date": "Aug 19, 2016"}, {"comment": "Left a cloudy Slate Pass around 10:30 Wednesday morning and hiked across Buckskin ridge. Soaking wet brush made me wish I'd packed gaiters. The trail across Buckskin was easy to follow and mileage accurate to Silver Lake. The lake was decent enough. Continuing past the lake the trail was considerably rougher and not always where USGS or Greentrails indicated. At one point, beyond Silver Pass, it drops far into the valley, goes down a bit,then climbs straight back up. Some blow down and difficult places to follow approaching Buckskin Lake but overall not bad. The signed and mapped mileage claimed 10 miles, I recorded 12.5. Buckskin Lake was a decent place to stay and I had it all to myself. One tragedy: I'd forgotten my spoon! Second time this year. I did remember that episode of McGuyver where he goes camping and forgets his spoon so I was able to cup up my beer can for a make-shift option. Overnight all the clouds blew away leaving a great star show.\r Recorded 12.5 miles with 3200ft gain. Some good trail, mostly rough trail.\r In the morning I debated a quick trip up to Buckskin Point but opted to just hike out since I was unsure if the mileage had any more surprises. Happily it was smooth sailing down to the river trail. At the Tatoosh Butte trail junction I found a sign indicating a washout ahead, the first I'd heard of. I went back down the trail aways to a marked cabin site to see if I could find anyone with more information but instead just found a flattened old cabin. Thankfully the washout was easily bypassed on foot.\r On the other side the trail was still easy to follow until Lease Creek where it entered an old burn. Most of the blowdown had been cleared but it was quite brushy until I climbed up above the burn, then easy going. Fanastic walking through high meadows along the ridge where I left the trail and went to the top of Tatoosh Buttes. Great place! I stayed up here a bit then took a lower route across Tamarack Ridge looking for water. I found a pretty smalll but clear stream and refilled before moving on to Ptarmigan. Easy walking to the top of a faint path but the length of the day was catching up with me now.\r Views from Ptarmigan were great in all directions! Well worth the two days to get here. I looked for a register but didn't find one. I had planned to drop down to Dot Lakes for the night but instead opted to make camp near the little tarn on the ridge. It let me have a high camp, still get Dot Peak and visit the lakes, and have a better view of the Perseids. Only downside would be a very cold night though I could live with that.\r I lounged around a few hours until sunset, watched a great colorful show, and turned in early. I set a 1 am alarm and woke to great stars and another night with faintly visible green from the northern lights. Perseids were going strong, the best show I'd ever seen.\r Recorded 16 miles with 4950ft gain. Mix of good trail, bad trail, and off-trail.\r In the morning I packed up and made a quick visit to Dot Mountain. Nice little peak! I had considered going through the col between Lago and Carru but I couldn't see a snow-free path. Going across in the early morning without snow travel gear was definitely a no-go. So instead I descended to Dot Lakes. Really beautiful lakes! So many larch. I saw a tent here, the first sign of a person since I started my trip, but no sign of its occupant.\r I refilled my water and began the long traverse out towards Butte Pass. I knew not to drop down to the Ptarmigan Creek trail. Every report of this one without fail mentioned it as an overgrown and unlogged misery slog. By comparison staying along the hillside wasn't bad. Some talus hopping, some meadow travel between sparse larch, and so on. Crossing the shoulder of Lago through a steep but treed gully wasn't terribly fun but worked. On the far side I opted to go higher onto the ridge rather than keep going out to Butte Pass. This worked though it did go through some steep dirt and rock ledges that were not pleasant. In hindsight just continuing the traverse out to Butte Pass would have been easier.\r Over Butte Pass I dropped down on trail and found a very nice tarn in the basin! Far too shallow to swim but very pretty. I had lunch here, soaked my feet, and eventually moved on to Shellrock pass. Emphasis on \"rock\". The trail faded in and out in the meadows but the higher parts were all fist-sized rocks. Views from the pass were nice though.\r Now it was once again down into another valley on rough trail. Easy to follow but rough, a bit overgrown, and some blowdown to make things interesting. Eventually I climbed back up towards Doris Lake on improving trail. I reached the lake a bit before 5pm, claimed a nice campsite, and called it a day. The lake was very pretty and just warm enough for a swim! The rest of the evening I just lounged around with my book. I saw one hiker go past into the higher campsites but no sign of the other occupants of the bigger tent.\r Overnight the clouds again blew away for one last great star show. It was also again colder than forecast and I really wished I'd taken the weight penalty to bring my 10 degree sleeping bag.\r Recorded 10.2 miles and 3800ft gain. About half off-trail, the rest crummy trail.\r Up reasonably early I decided to skip Osceola for a return trip and began the long hike back to Slate Pass. Somewhat rough and steep down to pretty Fred Lake and down to the main river trail. Then easy, fast, smooth sailing all the way back. Be warned many of the junctions are poorly signed and one major junction simply goes down to a massive horse-camp on the river. I crossed paths with several large groups heading into the cabin at the Pasayten airfield. I think it was a WTA volunteer vacation. They said nobody camps in the cabin due to mice but stay nearby and use its facilities.\r On my hike in I had no views from Slate Pass, now I had great blue skies! There was also a Forest Service pickup at the trailhead and a sign with information on the washout. Also cars parked in every single wide spot of the road. Popular place! I made the slow drive down the road and thankfully didn't meet another car coming across Deadhorse Point. Bought a great sandwich at the Mazama Store and a beer, drove up the highway to eat these at the Diablo Overlook, then the long drive back home.\r 12.2 miles with 2450 gain on the way out, almost all on very good trail for speedy travel.\r What a great area! I'll definitely be back.", "date": "Aug 10, 2016"}, {"comment": "This report is part of a six day trip. We came out from Lake of the Woods and hit the Monument Creek Trail around 6400 feet. From here the trail climbs to Pistol Pass, traverses for 3-4ish miles to a ridge, descends VERY steeply to Eureka Creek (where the bridge has been washed out for years) and then after fording the creek picks up the rest of the trail, now well-maintained for the last 3.5 miles out. Total length on Monument Creek Trail (not including Lake of the Woods mile side-trail) is about 10.5 miles. \r This trail has gone unmaintained for a long time. It is remarkable really then that the trail from where we picked it up, about a mile below Pistol Pass, all the way to the steep ridge, a distance of about 4 miles, was in pretty good condition. There are blow-downs with mostly easy work-arounds, and a big slide about a mile below Pistol Pass on the south side that will need dynamite to ever make it horse-accessible again.... but for human hikers we found the tread in good shape and the views terrific. \r The steep ridge is another matter. The 3ish miles and 2800 verts (5600 ft to 2800 ft) down is cairned and pathy in places. But many of the previous zig zagging switchbacks have been wiped out by slides over the years. Be prepared to sweat, curse and deal with choss, sand and talus along with blow-downs. \r Once you get to the creek, assuming it is not running with snowmelt, a reasonable ford is about 100 yards downstream. On the other side you can pick up the nicely maintained trail by pushing through about 20 feet of trees. The last 3.5 miles out are pleasant. \r In summary over the 10.5 miles we hiked DOWNHILL, the first 4 were in good condition and the last 3.5 were very pleasant. The middle 3 miles are the challenge. The whole 7.5 miles above the creek are in full sun and their is no water until Lake of the Woods. When you go I'd suggest starting early in the morning and getting extra water at Eureka Creek. But after you power up those middle 3 miles, the views and access to this part of the Pasayten high country is worth it.", "date": "Jul 28, 2016"}, {"comment": "We started at the Robinson Creek Trailhead mid-day with the plan of reaching a site we\u2019d camped at before, about 7.5-8 miles from the TH in a lovely meadow with a big rock to sit on with enough food for a 9 day trip, not sure where we\u2019d go but we would have options. Trail had obviously had more traffic than on Memorial Day weekend when we were there last- blowdown trees we\u2019d bushwhacked to get around now had bypass trails. Lots of brush starting around mile 3 and lasting until the ford of Robinson Creek, which was about mid-calf deep.  Our campsite has a very friendly deer that grazed close to us while her two fawns stayed a safe distance away.  The number of blowdowns along this trail to Robinson Pass is annoying but not terrible\u2026 There\u2019s a campsite near the Slate Pass junction that has water. \r Robinson Pass is lovely! To camp there you\u2019d need to carry water from the Slate Pass junction or head north of the Pass for a stream. The trickles we found there were muddy.  Trail here was in great condition! We saw baby grouse learning to fly and their fiercely protective mother ran us away in the other direction with a loud display. Adorable. More campsites at the second junction for Slate Peak in a meadow- looks like lots of campsite options and water there. We could see that blowdowns had been freshly cut in this area along with two backpacks, some tools and a thing we thought was for carrying logs. At this point the trail started to devolve into a mess of blowdowns. We met a hiker who told us the blowdowns were really terrible. He\u2019d camped at Tatoosh Buttes and still-snowy, Lake Doris. We thought he said he\u2019d come via Hidden Lakes and Shellrock Pass to get to Lake Doris in a big loop to avoid the blowdowns 2x, hmm\u2026 We continued through the blowdowns and next  we met the two FS men who were there to clear the trail, oh man do they have their work cut out for them \uf04c They said they had been working for two days and it looked like they might have cleared \u00bc to \u00bd a mile of trail. We do not believe it is an overestimation that there are well over 100 blowdowns per mile, and likely significantly more between here and the ford of the Pasayten River near the junction with Buckskin Ridge, about 9 miles away.  Every kind of blowdown: big, small, multiple trees, across the trail, along the trail. We ended up with the crotch fully ripping out in his pants (thanks OR for giving us a new pair today!) and I with two black and blue legs covered in bruises. \r By now we\u2019d covered over 10 miles, 5 of it very difficult. Lots of bear signs, including some of the biggest fresh claw marks we\u2019ve ever seen on a tree. Very important to practice bear safety here. I put the bear spray on my hip belt. We camped just beyond the junction to Lake Doris/Shellrock Pass near the noisy stream. The campsites here are small and fit our 2 person tent but don\u2019t think anything bigger would work here. We decided to try for a long day to Tatoosh Buttes and camp there. \r The next morning we continued traipsing over, under and around the blowdowns for another 5 agonizingly slow miles. Maybe a mile an hour and we normally hike 3mph in terrain like this, even with our 50+ lb packs. At the junction near the Pasayten River ford we found an old falling-apart handwritten FS sign stating that the trail ahead was impassible to stock due to a landslide and lots of trees down. We could see lots of trees down. We were tired of blowdowns so we decided to take the detour and ford the river, which was about knee deep. The trail beyond the river was downright pleasant compared to what we\u2019d been doing- occasional blowdowns, not brushy, etc. The forest was alive with the sounds of animals and trees creaking in the increasing wind. We reached the junction where you can continue straight on to the Pasayten Airfield but passed on the 2 mile detour this time and turned right. Here too is a sign stating that there is a landslide and the trail is impassible to stock. Hmm. So the detour for stock is also impassible to stock? This sign would be helpful at the first detour location. It is quite the landslide! The whole trail is missing on a very steep section and many trees have fallen into the river. We were able to easily get above it but it was not easy to descend back on to the trail. I took off my pack and lowered it to the trail before taking a controlled 3 foot feet first dirt slide to the trail- cautious because if I\u2019d slipped too far would mean falling quite a distance, possibly into the river. It looks like there should be a bridge here anchored on two large rocks but no bridge was in evidence. The water was deep and we could hear the rocks moving in the strong current. I think a ford here would be thigh deep in the shallowest sections. We found a two-tree collection to slide across with some difficulty- you either have to change trees mid-river or stay on one tree that ends a foot or two before you reach the other side of the river. Not for the timid, which I count myself as. \r The Tatoosh Buttes trail starts off in lovely forest alive with low underbrush and the sounds of birds. We had another tricky log crossing at Lease Creek, but a ford here wouldn\u2019t be deep if you wanted to take the time to deal with it.  We passed a marked junction for Lease Lakes\u2014but there is definitely no trail there\u2014just the signs. The trail gets very steep to the Buttes and the wind was viciously cold as the clouds grew dark and drizzly. We put on our raingear to block the wind first and secondly for the very light drizzle. Once on the ridgelines the trail gains and loses elevation through meadows and burned tree ghosts. It\u2019s lovely.  More mother grouse and babies. It\u2019s definitely baby season in the mountains! We were tired and didn\u2019t realize we\u2019d reached the buttes- having been eyeing the ridgeline towards Ptarmigan Mountain and mistaking it for the buttes along the way. We ended up camping on Tamarack Ridge in a meadow. There was a little trickle of water below the tallest Butte and another on the way to Tamarack Ridge but we don\u2019t know how long there will be water here for camping. This is a stunning, starkly beautiful place. Wow. The wind is bitingly cold and we put on all our warm layers, grateful we had a 15f double sleeping bag to snuggle up in.  We had brought microspikes, considering going over Ptarmigan and Dot mountain and back via the Col west of Lago... but from afar we could see that was clearly ice axe terrain. The small patches of snow at our elevation were very hard and it seemed likely we'd need crampons for that traverse right now. Boo. \r We *really* didn\u2019t want to go back through the 1000+ blowdowns,  especially as we were already down one person\u2019s pants (he was now hiking in sweaty hot rain pants that had a new tear in them). Despite all the joking about hiking without pants being the *new ultralight thing*, we really didn\u2019t want to do that and it would be painful. I repaired the pants a second time that evening (the repair had ripped out rather quickly that morning), hoping they might hold if we had to hike out through the blowdown town. The rangers had suggested we hike out via Hidden Lakes since it was freshly logged out! And we *thought* the one hiker we met said he had come via Shellrock Pass on the Monument Creek trail. It was marked on the green trails map as a dotted line, which in other areas usually means a passable trail (haha, not in the Pasayten!).  We decided to head for Shellrock Pass after spending the night at Hidden Lakes. \r The next morning it alternated between bitterly cold wind and snow and sunshine, finally settling upon bitterly cold wind and snow showers. We went to the ridge of Ptarmigan Peak and looked down at Ptarmigan Lake and the Tamarack valley. We could hear wolf cubs yipping in the breeze, sounding fairly close by. The snow turned to rain as we descended towards Hidden Lakes. There were maybe a dozen annoying blowdowns to contend with. A couple of small streams for water. Then we found freshly cleared trail about a mile from the lakes- heavenly! It\u2019s brushy in places but otherwise totally clear. The Hidden Lakes weren\u2019t visible until we were upon them, true to name. I wanted to find the Monument Creek trail for the next morning so we continued past the lakes for a while\u2026 never seeing a junction.  If the Lease Lakes trail wasn\u2019t on the map and had signs, shouldn\u2019t a trail on the map have a sign?! We pulled out the map and GPS and returned to the south end of the last lake where the trail should be. The talus is arranged like an old junction and the rocks made a neat crossing, like a trail should be there. But no trail. We bushwhacked a little through very thick underbrush, finding some old cut blowdowns\u2014this must have been the trail. Trail is no more. I cried, knowing we either had to go back the way we came or hike out to a different TH and figure out a way to get the 50 miles back to our car. We backtracked to the Hidden Lakes to think and camped at a major camp area with two outbuildings and a nice stream for water. There was an occupied tent near the hiker campsite- we walked right by and talked in case they would pop out and have information for us, or maybe even offer us a ride the next day? Maybe they were sleeping \uf04c  It rained but was pleasantly warm compared to Tatoosh Buttes. Things were not sounding good for us right now. No pants. Covered in bruises. On the plus side we still had 4 days left of food and more if we ate sparingly so we did have options. \r This was the first time we\u2019d ever wanted to use the satellite phone we carry for emergencies in the backcountry. We texted out and asked a friend if there was any taxi service in Mazama or Winthrop. Two hours later a message came back. Yes. Mountain Transport and here was their phone number. We contacted Mountain Transport and were told they usually want 2-3 days notice. We said we\u2019d try them back in a couple hours in case they changed their minds. We resolved that we\u2019d be going out via Billy Goat TH even if they said no- at the worst we camp at the TH until we can hitch a ride. On our second call, Mountain Transport agreed to get us at the Billy Goat TH (horse lot) at 3pm the next day for $279. We decided that was worth it to us and gave them our CC information to reserve the pickup.  That TH was 16 miles from where we were camped and an extra mile to the horse lot.  \r We were on the trail before 7am, knowing we\u2019d have to hike steadily and quickly to make it there on time. We made good time and were 5 miles on our way by 9:15am. We took a break near Diamond Creek after crossing a REAL BRIDGE (not the ford I\u2019d been anticipating) and enjoyed a snack.  The trail steadily climbs from here but never really steep. We moved slowly, wanting to conserve energy. About halfway to Lucky Pass is a pretty meadow area with a nearby trickle of water that could be a nice camp. We passed one party of two carrying an uncomfortable looking raft headed to Hidden Lakes. I\u2019d put that thing in a pack for a 16 mile hike! This made 3 hikers, 2 FS employees as our human total in 5 days. Almost to the pass is a pretty rocky outcrop. All along the way are amazing views of the surrounding peaks, Many Trails (which has no trails on the map, ha!), Three Pinnacles, Rampart Ridge. We took a longer 15 minute break to dry out our feet and enjoy the sunny weather- it was only 11:30am. Go us!\r Lucky Pass doesn\u2019t appear to have anywhere to camp. Lots of trees down and no water. We descended a steep rocky dry path for a while- no sign of the single long switchback on our GPS (marked on the map as a 2 mile alternate route). Many blowdowns had been cut- looks like this would have been very unpleasant before the log-out. The trail descends to cross Drake Creek on a bridge just after a junction stating that the Billy Goat TH was 4 miles ahead and a left turn towards Larch Creek (and Hidden Lakes 12 miles the other way). We were getting tired but 4 miles sounded manageable. The bugs were really bad in this section. I wear clothes treated in permetherin so they mostly avoided me but my sweetie was eaten alive. There were annoying bugs everywhere else along the trail besides Tatoosh Buttes but this area is by far the worst.  We hadn\u2019t read the map carefully\u2014another 1,000 foot gain to Eightmile Pass before the descent to the TH. This felt like a really long 4 miles to the gate at the road, followed by another mile to the horse lot. We arrived at 2:30pm with very tired feet and 1 minute later- the taxi showed up. The driver told us all about the area and his adventures on the 1.5 hour, 50 mile ride back to our car at Robinson Creek TH. FYI: should you ever have to hike out another trailhead in an unplanned fashion in the general area, the cabbie recommended that you make your way to a campground as they are regularly checked by FS employees, even in remote areas like FS Road 5130. The FS employees can radio out to call you a mighty expensive cab ride like ours, or you might find people willing to give you a ride! (I always carry $100 emergency cash in my 10 essentials for a scenario like this)\r Boy, this was long! Our route  58+ miles, 12500 elevation gain and 10500 loss over 5 difficult days.

If you stay on the trail and go upwards this will lead to the bigger bridge and a view of the smaller upper section of the falls.

A 1.3 mile road walk completes the loop.\r A bit long but summary of the trail conditions:\r PCT North Trailhead to Park Lakes:\rRoughly a dozen easily navigated downed trees and no problematic snow between the trailhead and Kendall Katwalk. A few minor snow patches before Ridge and Gravel Lakes including one very short steep snow bank at the junction with the camps. Several minor blowdowns and a few short snow patches exist on the north side of Alaska Mountain, but nothing presenting any issues. The Chikamin traverse is essentially snow free except for 3 patches that don't pose any real issues. We brought traction and axes but didn't use them.\r Park Lakes to Escondido Ridge:\rMany downed trees on the switchbacks descending to the Spectacle Lake trail slow progress but don't pose any issues. After Spectacle Lake the burn area has some brush with lots of wind fall although most are step-overs. As mentioned in many descriptions the first crossing of Lemah Creek is a ford and the trail continues to have minor brush issues and some downed trees thereafter. Near the head of the valley there are several large blowdowns obscuring the trail. The first can be navigated by going around to the left (if going northbound) and the second pile a bit further up valley requires some gymnastics. The long climb to Vista Lake on Escondido Ridge is brushy lower down and has roughly several dozen down trees that are easy to cross. We camped at a nice site next to Vista Lake.\r Escondido Ridge to Dutch Miller Gap:\rEscondido Ridge is gorgeous and the trail is in good condition. The switchbacks down to the Waptus River have several fallen trees and brush encroaches the trail lower down. The Dutch Miller Gap trail  is in great shape with only minor brush and windfall. Two trails go around Lake Ivanhoe on the way to the gap. We took the trail around the north side of the lake, but it is rough with lots of minor ups and downs. The southern shore trail had some snow but appears to be the most commonly used route around the lake. To get to the south side you cross the foot bridge over the outlet, continue uphill for a few minutes, and then cross back over the outlet on the old broken bridge. The trail up and over Dutch Miller is very rough and wet but straightforward.\r Dutch Miller Gap to Rock Creek Trail:\rThe Dutch Miller Gap trail is classically beautiful. Numerous down trees with only some requiring a small amount of gymnastics  and some brushy stretches, but overall the trail is in mostly good shape. The Middle Fork Trail to Goldmyer Hot springs has been maintained and is mostly clear of brush and downed trees. After Goldmyer the trail has a few downed trees and brush issues but nothing terrible. Burnboot Creek is crossed on a series of large fallen trees with notches cut in the top. Cross the logs to pick up the trail on the other side by a small sign on a tree that reads \"Burnboot Creek\". \r Rock Creek to Snow Lake Trailhead:\rThe Rock Creek Trail starts out nice with mostly small diameter downed trees. About a third of the way up the brush begins to get very thick and the tread is very uneven and sometimes seemingly non-existent. The trail is readily followed but the brush, several challenging downed trees, and the tread make for a grueling climb. The final mile or so to the Snow Lake junction is in good shape.

The hardest hike I had done at the time was 1600ft, and I knew this was going to be a huge test for myself and I was beyond excited. The road was easily accessible as it's right off the road. There were about 5 other cars in the parking lot on this Monday morning.The trail started out at an incline, and well.. it just stayed that way. We took the less difficult route and I still had to take many, many breaks. The scenery was amazing, in the beginning you can still see the road and the Columbia River Gorge, but after a while you just feel surrounded by forest.All the people on the way down just mentioned that it was very windy at the top. We made it to the puppy dog lookout and had our first introduction with the wind, it was brutal for sure. As soon as we stepped out in the open our hats blew off and we frantically ran after them. We enjoyed the view and kept trekking. I think I was in a euphoric state as I don't remember much except how small I felt compared to the view.We continued on and got to that last mile of the hike, and I knew from previous reports that I was just now getting to the hardest parts. My legs were killing me, but I knew there was no way we could turn around. Everyone else in my group was more experienced than me, and I just knew I had to continue. Once the trail opened up and we were walking on the ridge the weather conditions were extreme. The wind was forceful and there was hail flying UP the mountain. I was terrified and completely out of my element.I could see the storm clouds coming, and we were completely covered in clouds, there was no view, just white,wind, and a slippery muddy trail. Our party of four was split in two groups of two, and the only reason I kept going was because I could see the two people way ahead of us, and I knew if they could do it so could I. We kept going and then finally.. the top. There was still no view, and I was afraid everyone was going to be disappointed and then out of no where the clouds opened up and we were rewarded with the most beautiful view I had ever seen. We admired the view for a few minutes taking pictures and celebrating.We decided to take the whole loop down, I read it added .3 miles but it was easier on the knees and I figured I could really use that. The way down felt like it took forever, and even with the beautiful views my body felt shocked and exhausted. It was a birthday i'll never forget, and I can't wait to go backStats for the hike:\u00a07.3 miles2,844 ft. elevation3:58:31 moving", "date": "Apr 2, 2018"}, {"comment": "Great Hike!!

The elevation gain is very moderate, the trail was in great condition and easy to walk on (mostly soft forest floor), and the river was absolutely beautiful.

Dappled light and moss everywhere really make this a magical hike. Oh yeah, and the waterfalls were very pretty too!We encountered only a handful of other hikers, probably due to the fact that we hiked on a weekday, as well as the hike's great distance from I-5. It took us about 1.5 - 2 hours, but it was a beautiful drive and we didn't mind it.The one thing to look out for is the last 12-15 miles of road, after the Eagle Cliff Store. There are lots of fallen trees that partially cover the road. Some obscure an entire lane. They're light in color, and if you weren't paying close attention, it would be easy to hit one, so give yourself extra time through here.

At all.I forded the Chewuch (although you could probably cross on a big log jam just downstream of the crossing without getting wet), hiked back to the driveway trail, and remembered without joy how steep the driveway trail was on my way back to the car.\u00a0", "date": "Jul 14, 2017"}, {"comment": "Once I'd seen pictures of Upper Cathedral Lake, I knew I wanted to visit the Pasayten. \u00a0We planned a few approach routes, and ultimately decided to start at 30 Mile Trailhead. \u00a0We set off up the Chewuch trail in the blazing heat (there was a heatwave throughout most of our trip). \u00a0The first 6 miles are through a burn, and there are no options to camp until just before the Fire Creek trail comes in (where there's room for at least a few tents). \u00a0We camped there, and changed our plans. \u00a0We'd\u00a0hoped to go up to Windy Peak and Horsetooth Basin, but decided that due to limited water accessibility and the heat in the burn zone (the Windy Peak trail looked to have more burn along it), we'd go up the forested Tungsten Trail instead.This proved to be a good idea, as the trail was\u00a0well maintained, stayed mainly under treecover, and was lined by wildflowers. \u00a0We camped by the Tungsten Mine Cabin, where we found a somewhat maintained outhouse! \u00a0There's water access if you follow the wellworn social trail from the main cabin southwest (crossing the boundary trail) and then setting out across the somewhat boggy meadow (maybe a 15 minute stroll) to the beautiful little burbling Tungsten Creek.The next day we followed the Boundary trail over Apex and Cathedral Passes, and got our first incredible views of the North Cascades. \u00a0We camped near Upper Cathedral Lake, where inquisitive mountain goats came to visit. \u00a0Turns out they really do lick the urine off rocks...We spend our fourth day relaxing by the lake, visiting Lower Cathedral Lake (which seemed to be a lot less visited), and trying to summit Cathedral Peak (a bit too sketchy for us without gear).\u00a0Fifth day - we headed down to the Andrew's Creek trail, where we\u00a0planned to camp near Airview Lake. \u00a0When we couldn't find a trail up to Airview (turns out it's a faint scramble through the burn zone), and realized that the rest of our trip would be in an unpleasantly hot burn zone, we retreated back up to Remmel Lake and found a beautiful campsite with a reflected view of Remmel Mountain.Sixth day - we headed back down to the junction of the Chewuch and Tungsten Creek trails, where we'd found a great\u00a0campsite on our second day. \u00a0There's a perfect swimming hole fifty feet downstream of the creek confluence. \u00a0Seventh day - woke up extra early and hiked out through the burn zone before it got too hot. \u00a0Overall, it was a great trip. \u00a0We\u00a0saw only a few people the entire time, hiked well-maintained trails lined almost entirely with\u00a0wildflowers, and found incredible mountain views (and almost summited Cathedral!). \u00a0We'd gone into the trip expecting some pretty damaged trails (due to blowdowns in burnzones) but the forest service and horsepackers have done some incredible trail maintenance. \u00a0Every junction is signposted, and it's\u00a0one of the best maintained wilderness areas I've visited, with gorgeous campsites everywhere you'd expect them.Minor issues - we were warned about the bugs, but we didn't realize how bad they could be. \u00a0We brought picardin (bug spray that doesn't destroy gear) which helped, but we should have treated our clothes with permethrin\u00a0and brought headnets. \u00a0As it was, we wore our rain gear whenever we were in camp, and spent as much time as possible in the tent.\u00a0The heat wave was nice once we were up in the mountains (we barely had to use our layers until we were above 7000 feet), but made traversing the burn zones extremely unpleasant.Visit my website for my GPX track ~50 milesSpecific trail conditionsChewuch (30 Mile trailhead to Remmel Lake) - burn zone for the first 6 miles, beautiful all the rest of the way, with only a few downed trees in the path. \u00a0The first section west of Tungsten Creek has a lot of standing dead trees, potentially from disease and fungal infestation. \u00a0Tungsten (Chewuch to Tungsten Mine) - The start has the same standing dead from fungal infestation but gets beautiful after the switchbacks. \u00a0There's an incredible campsite on an somewhat island between two parts of Cinch Creek. \u00a0The top of the trail (right before the Boundary Trail) gets a bit marshy, but this is probably because we visited in early July (just after snowmelt).Boundary (Tungsten Mine to Remmel Lake) - in perfect condition, with only a small patch of snow on the trail southwest of Upper Cathedral Lake that will soon be melted out.Andrews Creek (Boundary trail to Andrew's Pass) - in great condition (with gorgeous new bridges) but made a bit unpleasant by the burn zone. \u00a0", "date": "Jul 7, 2017"}, {"comment": "Took a four day backpacking trip on the Cathedral Pass Loop from the Cathedral Drive TH with stops at Saddle Mountain, Apex Mountain, Upper Cathedral Lake, Cathedral Peak, Amphitheater Mountain, Four Point Lake, and Remmel Mountain.

Many abhor the crowds, and today people were out in numbers. I like solitude in nature, but it's inspiring to see so many people getting in touch with nature, getting exercise and feeling alive and touching the Earth.I took the Old Trail up Mount Si, through Boulder Garden. I left the parking lot at 7am and was on top of the Haystack at 903am, where I found a sunny ledge out of the wind and admired the world below and all around for a while.On the descent, I stopped at a switchback that over the years, has acquired a needless short cut. About a month ago, I started taking an interest in the spot. I spent about 30 minutes in late March hauling nearby logs and brush to fill in the spot and encourage people to hike around. But brash humans ignored my efforts and trampled new vegetation to bypass my attempts to reclaim the scarred earth for trees and shrubs.So today (Earth Day!), I spent about an hour there and redoubled my efforts, chatting with passing hikers - one fellow said \"good job, it looks like a beaver dam\", and monitoring traffic to make sure nobody attempted the shortcut. In the bigger picture, it's a small gesture on a heavily used mountain, but little efforts and intentions go along way when the seeds of inspiration takes root.More photos in my blog.http://www.communichi.org/earth-day-mount-si/", "date": "8 days ago"}, {"comment": "Weight Training run for Fred Hutch Climb to Fight in July.

"comments":[{"comment": "This is one of the nicest old growth forests that I have ever seen.\u00a0 This hike has been on my radar for 20 years but the long drive and the reputation of the trail being mean and nasty was a bit of a deterrence.Thank you to C P for his trail report yesterday.\u00a0 His mention of a massive Cedar near the end of the trail was just the carrot I needed to push me through the unpleasantries. \u00a0The drive to the trail from Bellevue was almost 2.5 hours.\u00a0 The Suiattle River road is 21.5 miles long with 10 miles of pavement and 11.5 miles of gravel.\u00a0 The gravel part has many potholes. The worst section was in the first 4 miles.\u00a0 The last 2 miles were in the best shape.The signed trail is on the left, about 100 yards before you come to the Sulphur Campground.\u00a0 The trail starts off on good maintained tread with a pleasant incline and gains 300 feet. The forest is very attractive, old modest size Doug Fir in the 3-5 foot range.\u00a0 The trail then drops a hundred feet and you enter a very old Fir forest with big fire scarred beauties up to 7.5 feet in diameter. The forest is dense and the trees are very tall. Many are leaning which adds to the beauty.\u00a0 I measure several of the biggest ones right around 250 feet tall! One particularly big one on the opposite side of the creek was 270 feet tall!! I use a Nikon Forestry Pro for height measurements.At 1.7 miles you have to traverse a nasty slide area to continue on.\u00a0 The pink flagging put there by C P yesterday was very helpful.\u00a0 I probably wouldn't have tried with out the flagging.\u00a0 It is still very challenging.\u00a0 Poor 9 year old Ms Maddy was barely able to negotiate it. I had to drag her by her collar up over some of the larger logs. \u00a0 Beyond the slide the trail is intermittently well established.\u00a0 There are lots of huge blowdowns that you have to either crawl under or over. It's actually pretty fun but slow going. I cleaned up many of the branches on the trail but there is plenty more to do.At 2.4 mile you enter a very old Cedar forest.\u00a0 The first 2 trees I measured were 10.1 and 10.7 feet in diameter.\u00a0 The big one that C P referred to was a whopping 11.7 feet in diameter.On the return trip I met a couple of young men from Kent who were looking for the illusive hot springs.\u00a0 I let them know that I've read many reports of people who spent hours bushwacking to find the springs only to come up empty handed.\u00a0 I did notice that the USGS topo map that I downloaded on my All Trails app showed the location of the hotsprings.\u00a0 I wasn't really sure that the map was accurate. It surely couldn't be that easy.\u00a0 We got to the location on the GPS and looked across the creek (actually 2 creek channels at this point) and within just a few minutes we think that we spotted them.\u00a0 There was a\u00a0 pile of rocks rising above the bank of the river with a white bucket and a large hose.\u00a0 One could get there by crossing logs over the creek channels but it looked a bit too dangerous for me.\u00a0 I may try again in the early fall when the water is more mellow.Earth Day Note:The Suiattle River valley and it's tributaries(Buck, Downey, Sulphur, Milk, Suiattle etc) have the best intact old growth forests in the entire Cascade range.\u00a0 Low elevation (under 2200 ft) intact old growth forest valleys in the Cascades are incredibly rare. The old time loggers were ambitious, tenacious and politically influential. Left unchecked they would have eventually chopped down every old growth forest in the state. Thank God for the environmental movement. Conservation groups like the NCCC, and the Sierra Club worked tirelessly back in the 50's and 60's to protect the North Cascades from logging and mining. Back in those day, the Forest Service's primary function was to facilitate timber and logging interests. Conservation was a very uphill battle. In 1960 the 1st version of the Glacier Wilderness was more of a victory for the timber industry as it only included high elevation territory devoid of big trees. It was shaped like an octopus that included the ridge lines and carefully excluded the low valleys.\u00a0Senator Henry Jackson of WA state saved the day. He was a powerful chair of the Senate Commmittee on Interior and Insular Affairs. Through some hard core political wrangling, in 1968 he was able to create the North Cascades National Park, the Ross Lake NRA, the Pasayten Wilderness, and an expanded version of the Glacier Peak Wilderness that included the low elevation valleys (Buck Cr, Downey Cr, Sulfur Cr, Suiattle River and others). I think that most hikers who enjoy our wilderness areas have no idea how lucky we are that these areas were saved.

It was near freezing and dusting of snow on a few passes but overall nice temps for backpacking at lower elevevations.\r I'm posting this trip report mainly to let people know that the East Fork Pasayten River trail (#451) from the Dollar Watch spur to Hidden Lakes junction (eastward) and southward all along Big Hidden Lake (Hidden Lakes trail) is quite difficult to walk. Last trip report of this trail (in August) listed a hundred trees down. I'm guessing after the big northwest windstorm a month ago a bunch more came down because over a 7 mile stretch there are more like over 200 blowdowns (maybe more?). Most are stepovers but some require reroutes through very thick new growth (see picture). It's very slow going and there are few suitable places to camp on this stretch (and fewer trees to hang a bear bag) and we could clearly tell this is primarily a game trail right now (bear, coyote, deer, elk). \r There are 2 streams at the north end of Big Hidden Lake that require either fording or a very tricky log crossing (with poles).\r Okanagan National Forest web site lists this trail as not having been cleared in the last 4 years. The blowdowns cease (southward) at the Tatoosh Buttes trail connection (there's a temp yellow paper sign) where stock users have kept the trail clear. \r Other than that all the other trails are in great shape.

Having already done the Cathedral Pass Loop a few years ago and loving the remote, desolate area, we jumped on board.  We fully expected the same type of trip with open country and easy to follow, well maintained trails.  Boy were we in for a big surprise! \r Our loop was as follows:  Andrews Creek TR to Andrews Pass to Rock Lake to Peepsight Lake to Fawn Lake / Ashnola Pass to Black Lake out to Lake Creek TR.   (Our friends went north to Sheep Mtn on day 5 but came out the same way).\r 8/27 \u2013 Andrews Creek\r Started at Andrews Creek trailhead around 1pm.  Andrews Creek trail #504 was in good condition but very dusty and hot.  Some logs to step over.  The area was burned in 2003 so there was little shade and with our heavy packs we did not make it far.  Camped at Blizzard Creek junction just past the gauging station in what used to be a camp.  The buildings that were here are gone from the fire.  Easy access to the river for water.\r 8/28 \u2013 Andrews Creek to Rock Lake\r Continued up Andrews Creek trail #504.  The trail to Peepsight #525 at 5,300 elevation is gone.  The sign is still there but it is overgrown and has downed logs over it.  We continued up to Andrew Pass instead.  There is a large camp located near the pass with water access.  At the Pass we headed to Rock Lake on Peepsight #525 (North loop).  There is a new sign but the trail (I would call it more of a path) itself is faint and easy to lose.  We followed cairns and made our way up to Rock Lake to camp.  \r 8/29 \u2013 8/31  - Rock Lake\r We camped three nights at Rock Lake and climbed Andrew, Amos, Peepsight and Freds.  The \u201cpath\u201d up to Crazy Man Pass (#525) is in pretty good shape although faint and hard to follow in places.  We added a bunch of cairns to improve the route as we knew we\u2019d be headed out that way.\r 8/31  - Rock Lake to Peepsight Lake\r We parted ways with our friends who headed North via Glory Creek #503A and Spanish Creek #503 to climb Sheep Mountain while we headed out via Black Lake.\r We took the path up to Crazy Man Pass #525 then down the other side.  We followed cairns through the basin almost to the small pond at the head of Peepsight Creek.  At some point we got impatient and made a short cut straight up the slope (north) to the saddle above Peepsight Lake where we caught up with the trail leading up the left (west) side of the slope.  It\u2019s unclear if the trail indicated on the green trail/USGS map # 525A is still there on the east side as we did not see it.  A very large bear was sighted in the basin. Good thing he wasn\u2019t too curious of us.\r The trail down to Peepsight Lake from the saddle was easy to follow.  Peepsight Lake is absolutely beautiful.  Not much in the way of wildlife here and it feels remote and desolate.  There are several camps at Peepsight Lake.  \r 9/1 - Peepsight Lake to Fawn Lake/Ashnola Pass\r Left Peepsight Lake following cairns on the Ashnola River trail #525.1, shown as a dotted line trail on the green trail map (which the key should mark as \u201cgood luck!\u201d).  This trail is not being maintained.  Getting down to elev 6,500 was challenging.  There are many, many downed trees and the trail was very hard to follow.  Further down it improved so that it was visible but we had to climb over many, many downed trees.  The trail is actually on the south side of Ashnola River not the north side as shown on the Green Trail/USGS maps.  The junction with Lake Creek #500, elevation 5,800 (section marked as Spotted Creek on the Green Trail Map) was easy to find and it looks like there used to be a big horse camp. The entire area is buried under logs now.  \r We were hoping that once we got on Spotted Creek / Black Lake trail #500 to Ashnola Pass it would be easy going.  Unfortunately, we were dead wrong.  This trail is also not being maintained although it was easier to follow.  We made our way to Fawn Lake where we set up camp at Ashnola Pass.\r 9/2 \u2013 9/3 \u2013 Fawn Lake / Ashnola Pass to Lake Creek TR\r Lake Creek Trail #500 trail between Ashnola Pass and Black Lake is abandoned and impassable. The trail in most cases is buried under logs over logs.  We must have stepped over, crawled under, climbed on +1000 trees.  The bridges are smashed out under downed trees.  Good navigation skills or GPS essential to stay on / near the trail.  Fortunately, the trail shown on both Green Trail and USGS maps are accurate but should now be completely erased.\r The top section above 4,800 feet was very slow going, taking about 2 hours per mile.  At around 3:00pm on 9/2 we got weathered out by a rainstorm at 5,100 ft. and had to set up camp.  We were lucky to find a small clear spot big enough for our tent (though not flat) and had enough water in our bladders for dinner and breakfast.\r The next day the weather improved and we decided to break camp and make a \u201crun\u201d for it.  Below 4,800 ft. it got very slightly better - we could take about 5 steps on the trail (wow!) before hitting an obstruction.  We finally got to Black Lake in the late afternoon and decided to make a bee line for the car instead of camping there as had been or original intention.  Below Black Lake the trail is in great condition with only 4 trees to go over \u2013 a walk in the park!  Got to Lake Creek TH at 5:40pm.\r We would not recommend this route.\r Happy Hiking!", "date": "Aug 27, 2016"}, {"comment": "Directions to the TH are good in Craig Romano's \"Day Hiking North Cascades\".  The trail begins in  a forest untouched by the 2003 wildfire that blackened most of the area. In 0.4 mile you enter the Pasayten Wilderness and begin walking in a blackened landscape which provides very little shade on a hot day like today! The trail climbs gradually and in a long 4 miles reaches Black Lake. The fireweed adds beauty to the blackened trees and stumps. Aspen will be beautiful in the fall. Twin flowers, scarlet gilia, yarrow, tiger lilies, columbine and spreading dogbane were some of the other flowers blooming.

Since snow was late this spring I decided on Eastern Washington. We headed over Hwy 20 to the Methow. The Methow Valley Information Center recommended the Lake Creek Trail, which is fairly level with gentle elevation gain, and has a campsite within 2 miles of the trailhead. We headed up the Chewuck to the trail after a good lunch at the Two Rivers Cafe. Twinflower, tiger lillies, and wild roses were blooming all along the trail, with a few paintbrushes and columbines here and there. I don't think I'd ever seen so many tiger lillies. Some were 5 feet tall with 6 blooms. The campsite was great - spacious, plenty of sun, nice fire pit, clean logs to sit on, and near the creek. A huge boulder was perched across the trail. I found post holes once used for a hitch rail behind it. We pitched camp about 5:00, started a campfire, and cooked dinner. We were serenaded by many different birdcalls, including the flycatcher's \"\"Quick! Free beer.\"\" On Saturday I started breakfast and attempted to filter water, only to find critters had chewed clean through the tubes on my water filter. Fortunately I was able to cut off the chewed parts. We hiked up to Black Lake. It was a bit of a stretch for Ben. The first mile from camp featured lots of brush growing on an old talus slope. For a child, it was quite a brush bash. I had to carry him through the thicker parts. There was more hawthorne here than I usually notice - but we enjoyed glorious stands of tiger lillies and beautiful budding nootka roses. One of our many rest stops on the way up was at flat, circular spot, bisected by the trail, and near a small stream. The brush was starting to take it over, but it looked like a former corral. It got me wondering about the history of the Pasayten, when sheep (Muir's hooved locusts) were driven up into the meadows during the hot summers. Fish were jumping at the lake, but a fisherman reported they had quit biting ever since he promised his wife they would keep and eat the next one he caught. I sat and read from William O. Douglas' \"\"Of Men and Mountains\"\" while Ben pretended he was a ninja turtle. Back at camp, a couple on their way out reported a bear in the area. Ben thought he saw one at the lake, perhaps it was the same bear. I was glad I had lugged in a bear-proof container. We woke late on Sunday, about 8AM. We heard pikas while breaking camp. An animal had chewed the straps of my trekking poles clean off- probably the squirrel busy scolding us. We made good time on the way out, despite Ben getting in a bad mood after tripping and falling. He didn't perk up until we neared Marblemount, where an Italian soda put him in a much better mood, and Dad got his Americano. The Lake Creek trail is in good shape but badly needs brushing out for the third mile. There are a few muddy spots, including a real bad one near Black Lake. The trail is popular with equestrians, so road apples are pretty common (a minor nuisance compared to motorcycle ruts). Only one small blowdown not far from the lake. The elevation gain is gentle.", "date": "Jul 6, 2002"}],

Glissading down is the best way to go so have an ice axe, trying to walk down that steep mountain would be hard and the parts we did have to walk to another section to glissade, we postholed.   I recommend an super early start so the snow is still compact (our 3 am start would have been great).  Once it warms up and turns slushy, it's  slippery and much harder to hike on.  You can camp in the parking lot, we got there later on Sat night (about 7:30 pm) and did not have a problem finding a spot. Some people set up tents, we slept in the back of the Subaru.

In my first year as WTA Executive Director, I was excited to have the chance to visit one of these crews, a group of eight teens and two fearless leaders who worked for a week to replace several failing bridges with more durable elevated trails. But, I knew a visit from the WTA ED was unlikely to be a big treat for our hardworking young volunteers, so decided to bring them a watermelon for an added bonus.About five years ago, I made the transition to lightweight (not ultra-light) backpacking, and this trip was a good reminder of why that was a good switch. About a half mile down the trail, weighed down by the watermelon and my old extra-large, extra-heavy backpack, I was definitely wondering what was wrong with just bringing chocolate.The trail starts from Slate Pass with amazing views in all directions. The\u00a0first three miles were\u00a0a lovely descent among wildflowers to\u00a0a rock hop across the Middle Fork Pasayten River (my feet got a little wet). About a half mile beyond the river crossing is the junction with the Robinson Creek Trail. After the junction, the trail is more about forest solitude than big mountain views, although you do get occasional glimpses of the surrounding hillsides. The trail is in good shape, with only a few places of erosion and a couple of downed trees, all of\u00a0which are easy to avoid.There weren\u2019t many campsites along the first 12 miles of trail, but two are worth noting. Just past the junction with the Robinson Creek Trail is a spur trail to a large campsite along the river. Also, at approximately 6.5 miles from Slate Pass is another nice campsite just off the trail by the river.The lower-back strain from the watermelon pushed me to hike as fast as I could and I was not sad to arrive at the WTA crew camp at the junction of the Middle Fork Pasayten/Robinson Creek Trail and Buckskin Ridge Trail. \u00a0As expected, the arrival of the watermelon was the most exciting part of my visit, and we chilled it in the river before serving it after dinner. Over the watermelon dessert, I enjoyed hearing from the teens about the work they were doing to improve the trail (a lot of wading in mud; a lot of rock hauling), and I was sad that I didn\u2019t have time to stick around to work with them then next day.I was on the trail early the next morning headed back to Slate Pass. I was happy to not be carrying the watermelon back out, but even without it, it felt like a very long 12 miles. Thankfully, the last three miles (where you get most of the 2500 feet of elevation gain) were glorious, distracting me somewhat from my misery. And, my spirits were also lifted in the final stretch by running into WTA friend and hiking guide\u00a0author, Craig Romano, who was doing research for an update to his book, Day Hiking in the North Cascades.\u00a0All in all, the trip was a lot of fun, but it also forced me to admit I\u2019m not as spry as I once was: hiking 24 miles in 24 hours was exhausting and my feet are still paying the price.", "date": "Jul 26, 2017"}, {"comment": "I climbed Robinson Mountain on Saturday, June 24, 2017. \u00a0The mountaintop was snow free, as was the summit ridge.Robinson creek trail was cleared of trees and in excellent shape, with many flowers along the way. \u00a0Shortly (~50 feet) after crossing the bridge at Beauty Creek (flowing strong), I got onto the climbing route, which was well defined and climbed up along the west side of Beauty Creek. \u00a0After hiking a while, that path crosses a tributary, and then turns left and continues uphill (very steep) towards a tarn in a basin below Robinson Mountain. \u00a0I lost the path here and switchbacked through forest and meadows for an hour or so until reaching the tarn. \u00a0At the tarn, I headed straight up for the summit ridge in a boot path that had been kicked into the snow probably within the previous 2 days or so. \u00a0Those climbers had on crampons and an ice axe, and I was glad I brought mine as well. \u00a0Snow was soft, not very deep in places, and probably wont be around for much longer, but ascending in scree would have been really miserable.After gaining the summit ridge, Rose dog and I traversed across and over the several subpeaks before carefully navigating the short \"airy\" scramble up a steep gully and over some weathered rock before the final subpeak to the mountain. \u00a0I almost turned back\u00a0before attempting this, but the more I looked at it, the more doable it seemed, and ultimately was. \u00a0The challenge was coming back down the scramble (had to carry Rose-dog a fair bit), but this was made easier because I stayed to the immediate right of the gully and descended over the rocks instead of sliding down through it.Slept at the tarn and quickly hiked down the next morning, mostly off trail. \u00a0Towards the tributary corssing, I found the remains of the climber's path I lost the day before. \u00a0Look for a small cairn on your left hand side that goes up, up, up through the meadow as soon as you cross the tarn outlet stream near its confluence with Beauty Creek. \u00a0You should be able to follow it, at least for a while.\u00a0Beautiful views. \u00a0Looking north towards the south slopes of the Pasayten, the mountainsides were mainly snow free. \u00a0Looking south towards the north slopes of the North Cascades, the mountainsides still looked pretty socked in.\u00a0", "date": "Jun 24, 2017"}, {"comment": "We camped near the trailhead and got started at about 6 for a long day. The hike is as described in \"75 Scrambles in Washington.\" We varied from the description once we reached the cirque by ascending to the left to gain the ridge instead of hiking straight, up the steepest portion, though it wouldn't matter later in the year when the snow was more settled or gone. \rThe final ascent looks worse than it is but is still somewhat exposed and requires some experience. We roped up on the descent to be on the safe side since we hauled the gear all the way up there. We got back to the trailhead around 8 pm. A long day but well worth it. A much more detailed description of the hike is linked below.", "date": "Jun 3, 2017"}, {"comment": "We started at the Robinson Creek Trailhead mid-day with the plan of reaching a site we\u2019d camped at before, about 7.5-8 miles from the TH in a lovely meadow with a big rock to sit on with enough food for a 9 day trip, not sure where we\u2019d go but we would have options. Trail had obviously had more traffic than on Memorial Day weekend when we were there last- blowdown trees we\u2019d bushwhacked to get around now had bypass trails. Lots of brush starting around mile 3 and lasting until the ford of Robinson Creek, which was about mid-calf deep.  Our campsite has a very friendly deer that grazed close to us while her two fawns stayed a safe distance away.  The number of blowdowns along this trail to Robinson Pass is annoying but not terrible\u2026 There\u2019s a campsite near the Slate Pass junction that has water. \r Robinson Pass is lovely! To camp there you\u2019d need to carry water from the Slate Pass junction or head north of the Pass for a stream. The trickles we found there were muddy.  Trail here was in great condition! We saw baby grouse learning to fly and their fiercely protective mother ran us away in the other direction with a loud display. Adorable. More campsites at the second junction for Slate Peak in a meadow- looks like lots of campsite options and water there. We could see that blowdowns had been freshly cut in this area along with two backpacks, some tools and a thing we thought was for carrying logs. At this point the trail started to devolve into a mess of blowdowns. We met a hiker who told us the blowdowns were really terrible. He\u2019d camped at Tatoosh Buttes and still-snowy, Lake Doris. We thought he said he\u2019d come via Hidden Lakes and Shellrock Pass to get to Lake Doris in a big loop to avoid the blowdowns 2x, hmm\u2026 We continued through the blowdowns and next  we met the two FS men who were there to clear the trail, oh man do they have their work cut out for them \uf04c They said they had been working for two days and it looked like they might have cleared \u00bc to \u00bd a mile of trail. We do not believe it is an overestimation that there are well over 100 blowdowns per mile, and likely significantly more between here and the ford of the Pasayten River near the junction with Buckskin Ridge, about 9 miles away.  Every kind of blowdown: big, small, multiple trees, across the trail, along the trail. We ended up with the crotch fully ripping out in his pants (thanks OR for giving us a new pair today!) and I with two black and blue legs covered in bruises. \r By now we\u2019d covered over 10 miles, 5 of it very difficult. Lots of bear signs, including some of the biggest fresh claw marks we\u2019ve ever seen on a tree. Very important to practice bear safety here. I put the bear spray on my hip belt. We camped just beyond the junction to Lake Doris/Shellrock Pass near the noisy stream. The campsites here are small and fit our 2 person tent but don\u2019t think anything bigger would work here. We decided to try for a long day to Tatoosh Buttes and camp there. \r The next morning we continued traipsing over, under and around the blowdowns for another 5 agonizingly slow miles. Maybe a mile an hour and we normally hike 3mph in terrain like this, even with our 50+ lb packs. At the junction near the Pasayten River ford we found an old falling-apart handwritten FS sign stating that the trail ahead was impassible to stock due to a landslide and lots of trees down. We could see lots of trees down. We were tired of blowdowns so we decided to take the detour and ford the river, which was about knee deep. The trail beyond the river was downright pleasant compared to what we\u2019d been doing- occasional blowdowns, not brushy, etc. The forest was alive with the sounds of animals and trees creaking in the increasing wind. We reached the junction where you can continue straight on to the Pasayten Airfield but passed on the 2 mile detour this time and turned right. Here too is a sign stating that there is a landslide and the trail is impassible to stock. Hmm. So the detour for stock is also impassible to stock? This sign would be helpful at the first detour location. It is quite the landslide! The whole trail is missing on a very steep section and many trees have fallen into the river. We were able to easily get above it but it was not easy to descend back on to the trail. I took off my pack and lowered it to the trail before taking a controlled 3 foot feet first dirt slide to the trail- cautious because if I\u2019d slipped too far would mean falling quite a distance, possibly into the river. It looks like there should be a bridge here anchored on two large rocks but no bridge was in evidence. The water was deep and we could hear the rocks moving in the strong current. I think a ford here would be thigh deep in the shallowest sections. We found a two-tree collection to slide across with some difficulty- you either have to change trees mid-river or stay on one tree that ends a foot or two before you reach the other side of the river. Not for the timid, which I count myself as. \r The Tatoosh Buttes trail starts off in lovely forest alive with low underbrush and the sounds of birds. We had another tricky log crossing at Lease Creek, but a ford here wouldn\u2019t be deep if you wanted to take the time to deal with it.  We passed a marked junction for Lease Lakes\u2014but there is definitely no trail there\u2014just the signs. The trail gets very steep to the Buttes and the wind was viciously cold as the clouds grew dark and drizzly. We put on our raingear to block the wind first and secondly for the very light drizzle. Once on the ridgelines the trail gains and loses elevation through meadows and burned tree ghosts. It\u2019s lovely.  More mother grouse and babies. It\u2019s definitely baby season in the mountains! We were tired and didn\u2019t realize we\u2019d reached the buttes- having been eyeing the ridgeline towards Ptarmigan Mountain and mistaking it for the buttes along the way. We ended up camping on Tamarack Ridge in a meadow. There was a little trickle of water below the tallest Butte and another on the way to Tamarack Ridge but we don\u2019t know how long there will be water here for camping. This is a stunning, starkly beautiful place. Wow. The wind is bitingly cold and we put on all our warm layers, grateful we had a 15f double sleeping bag to snuggle up in.  We had brought microspikes, considering going over Ptarmigan and Dot mountain and back via the Col west of Lago... but from afar we could see that was clearly ice axe terrain. The small patches of snow at our elevation were very hard and it seemed likely we'd need crampons for that traverse right now. Boo. \r We *really* didn\u2019t want to go back through the 1000+ blowdowns,  especially as we were already down one person\u2019s pants (he was now hiking in sweaty hot rain pants that had a new tear in them). Despite all the joking about hiking without pants being the *new ultralight thing*, we really didn\u2019t want to do that and it would be painful. I repaired the pants a second time that evening (the repair had ripped out rather quickly that morning), hoping they might hold if we had to hike out through the blowdown town. The rangers had suggested we hike out via Hidden Lakes since it was freshly logged out! And we *thought* the one hiker we met said he had come via Shellrock Pass on the Monument Creek trail. It was marked on the green trails map as a dotted line, which in other areas usually means a passable trail (haha, not in the Pasayten!).  We decided to head for Shellrock Pass after spending the night at Hidden Lakes. \r The next morning it alternated between bitterly cold wind and snow and sunshine, finally settling upon bitterly cold wind and snow showers. We went to the ridge of Ptarmigan Peak and looked down at Ptarmigan Lake and the Tamarack valley. We could hear wolf cubs yipping in the breeze, sounding fairly close by. The snow turned to rain as we descended towards Hidden Lakes. There were maybe a dozen annoying blowdowns to contend with. A couple of small streams for water. Then we found freshly cleared trail about a mile from the lakes- heavenly! It\u2019s brushy in places but otherwise totally clear. The Hidden Lakes weren\u2019t visible until we were upon them, true to name. I wanted to find the Monument Creek trail for the next morning so we continued past the lakes for a while\u2026 never seeing a junction.  If the Lease Lakes trail wasn\u2019t on the map and had signs, shouldn\u2019t a trail on the map have a sign?! We pulled out the map and GPS and returned to the south end of the last lake where the trail should be. The talus is arranged like an old junction and the rocks made a neat crossing, like a trail should be there. But no trail. We bushwhacked a little through very thick underbrush, finding some old cut blowdowns\u2014this must have been the trail. Trail is no more. I cried, knowing we either had to go back the way we came or hike out to a different TH and figure out a way to get the 50 miles back to our car. We backtracked to the Hidden Lakes to think and camped at a major camp area with two outbuildings and a nice stream for water. There was an occupied tent near the hiker campsite- we walked right by and talked in case they would pop out and have information for us, or maybe even offer us a ride the next day? Maybe they were sleeping \uf04c  It rained but was pleasantly warm compared to Tatoosh Buttes. Things were not sounding good for us right now. No pants. Covered in bruises. On the plus side we still had 4 days left of food and more if we ate sparingly so we did have options. \r This was the first time we\u2019d ever wanted to use the satellite phone we carry for emergencies in the backcountry. We texted out and asked a friend if there was any taxi service in Mazama or Winthrop. Two hours later a message came back. Yes. Mountain Transport and here was their phone number. We contacted Mountain Transport and were told they usually want 2-3 days notice. We said we\u2019d try them back in a couple hours in case they changed their minds. We resolved that we\u2019d be going out via Billy Goat TH even if they said no- at the worst we camp at the TH until we can hitch a ride. On our second call, Mountain Transport agreed to get us at the Billy Goat TH (horse lot) at 3pm the next day for $279. We decided that was worth it to us and gave them our CC information to reserve the pickup.  That TH was 16 miles from where we were camped and an extra mile to the horse lot.  \r We were on the trail before 7am, knowing we\u2019d have to hike steadily and quickly to make it there on time. We made good time and were 5 miles on our way by 9:15am. We took a break near Diamond Creek after crossing a REAL BRIDGE (not the ford I\u2019d been anticipating) and enjoyed a snack.  The trail steadily climbs from here but never really steep. We moved slowly, wanting to conserve energy. About halfway to Lucky Pass is a pretty meadow area with a nearby trickle of water that could be a nice camp. We passed one party of two carrying an uncomfortable looking raft headed to Hidden Lakes. I\u2019d put that thing in a pack for a 16 mile hike! This made 3 hikers, 2 FS employees as our human total in 5 days. Almost to the pass is a pretty rocky outcrop. All along the way are amazing views of the surrounding peaks, Many Trails (which has no trails on the map, ha!), Three Pinnacles, Rampart Ridge. We took a longer 15 minute break to dry out our feet and enjoy the sunny weather- it was only 11:30am. Go us!\r Lucky Pass doesn\u2019t appear to have anywhere to camp. Lots of trees down and no water. We descended a steep rocky dry path for a while- no sign of the single long switchback on our GPS (marked on the map as a 2 mile alternate route). Many blowdowns had been cut- looks like this would have been very unpleasant before the log-out. The trail descends to cross Drake Creek on a bridge just after a junction stating that the Billy Goat TH was 4 miles ahead and a left turn towards Larch Creek (and Hidden Lakes 12 miles the other way). We were getting tired but 4 miles sounded manageable. The bugs were really bad in this section. I wear clothes treated in permetherin so they mostly avoided me but my sweetie was eaten alive. There were annoying bugs everywhere else along the trail besides Tatoosh Buttes but this area is by far the worst.  We hadn\u2019t read the map carefully\u2014another 1,000 foot gain to Eightmile Pass before the descent to the TH. This felt like a really long 4 miles to the gate at the road, followed by another mile to the horse lot. We arrived at 2:30pm with very tired feet and 1 minute later- the taxi showed up. The driver told us all about the area and his adventures on the 1.5 hour, 50 mile ride back to our car at Robinson Creek TH. FYI: should you ever have to hike out another trailhead in an unplanned fashion in the general area, the cabbie recommended that you make your way to a campground as they are regularly checked by FS employees, even in remote areas like FS Road 5130. The FS employees can radio out to call you a mighty expensive cab ride like ours, or you might find people willing to give you a ride! (I always carry $100 emergency cash in my 10 essentials for a scenario like this)\r Boy, this was long! Our route  58+ miles, 12500 elevation gain and 10500 loss over 5 difficult days. I think once the Pasayten River section is logged out this hike will be much easier \uf04a The FS guys said it was a priority because Slate Pass road will be opening soon. I\u2019d check with the Rangers before heading out unless you enjoy this sort of adventure!", "date": "Jul 2, 2016"}],

The last 1.5 miles is very exposed and thus the snow is soft by midday. Be ready for some post holing.

There is a substantial amount of snow on the mountain still however, which can be a nuisance to some. There were a lot of people on the mountain today, 50+ by my count, so it's definitely getting more popular. This trail is dog friendly and most kids (8+) can probably make it too if they have a bit of help.Road: Great shape - Get to the TH early if going on a nice weekend... It was full and backed up to the road when I left around 1 p.m.Trail: Great shape through and through. The route isn't especially well-marked, but it's still quite obvious where to go the entire time.Snow: Snow first appears a few minutes before the 2-mile mark (trail intersection with the Great Wall Trail) and covers the route at roughly 2.3 miles. The snow is well-packed and, easy to follow and post-holing is not really an issue provided you stay on the compacted snow.Gear: I did it in just my boots (waterproof is necessary) and my bag. Most individuals had at least spikes and trekking poles. I didn't struggle going up without extra gear, but some people might find it helpful to have them.If you hike over the next few days be aware that the snow is going to be very soft. Spikes and snowshoes will be relatively useless if you go in the afternoon, although in the early morning they will still prove beneficial.

Many bicycles so you have to stay on the side but that's no biggie. It's a pretty wide path so there is plenty of room for everyone. The tunnel is pretty cool considering when it was built, without all the new fancy equipment we have now. A snow/rock shed was added onto the tunnel to protect people from falling rocks. Very thoughtful. It really is a great place to walk. Fall colors are in and beautiful views of the Columbia River Gorge. I made the mistake of wearing my trail runners and since it was all paved they do not perform well and I ended up with some gnarly blisters. Didn't keep me off the trail though and hiked 2 more after this in the next 2 days. All you need is tennis shoes and a snack and water. You'll be fine. When you're done here be sure to continue on driving Hwy 30 East to Rowena Crest.

And I am happy to report that at this time, there's no snow on Tiger! Yay!I did the four summit loop to maximize my time and mileage. I started at High Point parking lot and took the Nook Trail (lot of flowing streams and wet trail) up to the junction with with Talus and took a right. I then headed up to the left what is labeled an unmaintained trail, but is really the section line and is the steepest part of Tiger, I'd say. The roots were slick and there is lots of muddy areas, but nothing to bad. After the steep climb, I took a right onto Railroad Grade for some flat reprieve before the trail popped be out the the junction for Poo Poo Point when comign via high school. I'd only seen 2 people up til this point. I hiked down to Poo Poo Point and watched the paragliders for a bit and then hiked back to the intersection and went up the One View Trail. At the end of this, I took a right and kept going until I came to the split with a trail that is evading my memory but you head up and to the left... it's quite steep to start. This will pop you out onto the forest road but continue straight on the trail signed Poo Top. This ridge section is also quite steep at times. Eventually you end up at the Tiger 1 summit. Continue down and then to the left, toward Hiker's Hut, my favorite view on the mountain, though no Rainier yesterday. The peaks of the Olympics were just visible above the cloud layer.I headed down the road and then past the gate and up to Tiger 2 summit, and then down and over to the Tiger 3 summit. Up til this point, I'd seen only two additional people (minus Poo Poo Point area). I followed Tiger 3 back down to the lot to complete my loop, and had a nice conversation with an older man named George, who was making it look easy at age 80!

I didn't want to go anywhere with a lot of snow by myself but I did want to get some training in so I took the West Tiger 3 trail up, then down the Section Line trail to the Nook Trail with a small detour on the Talus Rock loop to see the seasonal waterfall. You can see\u00a0my route on the link I'm attaching to this report.My app says this was a 5.08 mile loop with 1904 ft gain. I started at 2pm and finished at 5pm, plenty of parking in the lot. I estimate the detour to the waterfall was, oh, 800 feet round trip & maybe 10 minutes walking. I plotted my stops out on my app since I'm not that familiar with Tiger Mountain trails and I've gotten lost on Squak before. I did have numerous people stop and ask me for directions or advice on which way they were headed, so I advise looking up your trail beforehand if possible.\u00a0West Tiger 3 had some water running across the trail, mud, puddles in parts. I made a friend on the trail and he skirted the edges of the more water-logged parts. I was wearing gaiters with trail runners and didn't even get my socks wet. As always, I recommend poles for descending if you have cranky knees like mine, especially on the more slippery parts of Section Line. It was muddy in places and had slippery tree roots, a handful of downed trees to navigate around, but in great shape (definitely not as straightforward as West Tiger 3 and I was doubting that I had the right trail from the summit as I began my descent).New friend did not cross the stream at the bottom of the seasonal waterfall where the best photos were to be had due to not wanting to get shoes wet, so of course, I recommend footwear that can ford a small stream and careful crossing.\u00a0We did encounter a hiker on the Nook Trail who said he saw a black bear running away from the trail.

Making my way across the street and into the forest, I was a little confused about which way I need to go to get to my destinations since there are several trails (all numbered, rather than named). Fortunately there are several maps posted at junctions throughout the trail network, so I never did get too turned around.Heading uphill on the 110 trail to Saddle Junction, I knocked out most of the elevation for this trip in the first hour. At Saddle Junction (the intersection of several trails and Kit Carson Loop Road), I encountered the only other humans I was to see the entire day: one cyclist heading uphill, followed by three more cyclists on their way down. I made a left turn at the well signed \"Mt. Kit Carson\" trail (#160), and followed it to the summit. From there, I kept on towards Day Mountain for my second summit and another great view. Rather than backtrack towards Kit Carson, I followed the #130 towards Saddle Junction again. This time, I headed up the #140 trail towards the summit of Beauty Mountain and the CCC cabin. I had thought about hiking up to the top of Mount Spokane as well, but by this point it was getting pretty warm out and I wasn't feeling up to the additional mileage and elevation (I did wind up driving to the top once I got back to my car though).All together, I tracked about 10.5 miles and 2300 ft of elevation gain in a little under five hours with only birds and squirrels for company on the trail.

We started a small fire in the stove in the cabin to warm ourselves for the hike back. If you want to use the stove, I recommend bringing dry newspaper or a fire starter.

The snow is long gone now, and I did this trail run in shorts & a t-shirt on a gorgeous, sunny day.  The rain knocked most of the golden larch needles off the trees, but there are still some fall colors out.  Trail 130 is among the best in the park for views, with its south-facing open slopes, and my turn-around was at the aptly named Beauty Mountain (home of the CCC cabin, which has received a lot of sprucing up in the past year).  The trail is a bit on the muddy side, but not too bad.  Since the summit road is closed, trail 130 must be accessed from the very bottom at the SnoPark lot.

It was interesting that just fifty feet away on the edge of Fox Pond the little guy's adversary, a great blue heron was hunting the shallows.I decided on going\u00a0 out to Porpoise Point since I had never been there before so I took the first trail to the right after passing the pond and right again on the Calamity trail. In a short time there is a junction that has one of the old wood signs, \"Upper Loop trail-Park Boundary\", go left here or you will be going toward private property. this trail climbs steeply and then drops down to join the Porpoise Point trail again. From here you will descend over two hundred feet to the point. Porpoise Point is a dramatic area of several headlands, sharp rocks and small beaches between cliffs. If you are hiking with kids, keep them close here as there is loose rock, roots and loosely attached moss near the edges of the trail.I made a loop and returned on the Sunburst and Madrone trails back up to the main trail that goes to Sares Head.Note: The road between where the turn-off from Hwy-20 to Deception Pass is now one-way due to construction most of the way towards Lake Campbell.

I knew I wanted to get on a trail at some point &\u00a0 I was determined not to let the promise of rain detour me.\u00a0 I stayed at an Air Bnb nearby that wasn't yet ready for check in so I got on All Trails & WTA to see what was nearby. I almost went to Heart Lake but I read a few great things about the scenery here & it was just up the road, so I went for it.\u00a0\u00a0I am glad I had waterproof boots & a warm hat/wind breaker, as it was not only very windy (gusts up to 40mph on the coast today). The trail was wet/muddy on and off & on and washed out at times.\u00a0 The trail map at the trailhead is confusing & not very descriptive,(but there is a little keyosk with\u00a0 trailmaps that is helpful, I missed it unfortunately). The Trailhead Map is very general & doesn't show all the little connector trails/loops but it all does connect in the end & takes you back to the parking lot in no time.\u00a0 I did 2.4 miles total.I started on Sares Head Trail & took the upper loop which very quickly had a huge, fresh tree down on the trail and also a sign at the Upper Loop that had fallen so the directions were confusing. I took the Calamity Trail to Porpoise Point Trail, (which had some Amazing views) a little bit of Sunburst to the Madrone trail which was pretty washed out; I almost turned around but I took at pic at the trailhead of the map and all the little trails were'nt on it.\u00a0 Had I known I would've stayed on the Sunburst Trail > Sares Head Overlook.\u00a0 Instead I took Madrone > Sares Head Overlook which was stunning & then headed back on the lower loop. It was so windy I was a little worried a branch would eventually fall on my head so I didn't stay as long as I would've liked.\u00a0 I was also getting hungry so that was my Que.The weather report has reported rain the last 3 saturdays, however, I did not get rained on, in fact, it was absolutely gorgeous weather if not for the wind factor.\u00a0 If it's not \"snowing\" tomorrow as predicted, I'm hoping to find some other trails before I head back to the concrete jungle.\u00a0\u00a0", "date": "Feb 17, 2018"}, {"comment": "From the trail head we followed the Sares Head Trail and took the second trail to the west, the Sunburst Trail. This leads you through a predominately Madrone tree forest with Douglas fir and cedar. The madrone are always fascinating\u00a0 and here they come in all forms from skinny branch like trees to huge multi trunk that stand out in their red color among the green mosses and ferns. Working our way north we crossed a footbridge over small waterfall that was running fairly full judging from the notch it was flowing through. We came to a junction with a bench where the trail continues down to the Porpoise Point Trail. We took a right here and took the Madrone Trail which goes up and intersects with a portion of the Porpoise Trail again (no signage there) and we went right to the junction with the Sares Head Trail again. If you look carefully you see a wood sign that says Montgomery-Duban Headlands Rock Bluff, but newer maps and signage now call this the Madrone Trail. From there we turned left onto the Sares Head Trail and shortly we were along the shore of Fox Pond and then on back to the trail head.For the most part the trail is in good condition but there is a section of the Madrone Trail that is under a few inches of water and the muck along the edge is also several inches deep.", "date": "Jan 16, 2018"}, {"comment": "Today it was Bob and Beth, not Bob and Barb! I have two minor health issues which kept me from hiking today so our daughter, Beth, who lives in Edmonds drove up to Bayview SP to hike with her dad on this beautiful sunny day! \u00a0I had printed a map of the area before we left home as I had read there was a fairly new trail, \u00a0Broom Tomb Loop Trail. They were glad they had this as apparently some of the trails have been renamed and their map matched the names at the trail junctions. Bob said many of the signs looked new. They began by hiking to Sares Head. They did a short section of the Broom Tomb Loop Trail before going to the viewpoint at Sares Head. From there they did a loop via the Sunburst Trail, Porpoise Point Trail to the junction of the 0.28 mile Calamity Trail which they took to where it rejoins the Porpoise Point Trail and then the Sares Head Trail to return to the parking area. They had the pleasure of meeting and talking to LizzyRN who had hiked to Sares Head. She had fallen and injured her knee and it had taken her 2 hours to get down to their meeting point.

Luckily I had a pre-built GPS route through the area and downloaded it to my phone, otherwise that area would have been tricky. After coming through there we met up with British Army trail to Lily Lizard lake loop. Then up to North Butte and down Max's shortcut and across to Samish Overlook. We started around 6:45am and finished about 3:30. All told it was about 19 miles. The trails were all great, but the logging roads area is a bit confusing with several trees across the road. It started off sunny today and ended up clouding over, but still a great hike. The one surprise was how many mosquitos were out, Everytime we stopped we got swarmed.\u00a0 If you plan to connect Chuckanut and Blanchard I would highly advice a pre-planned route with GPS capabilities to get from one to the other.\u00a0", "date": "3 days ago"}, {"comment": "With Spring showing its season in full\u00a0strength\u00a0I went for an overnight at Lily Lake.

We continued up in the warm sunny day not yet use to either the sun or warmth since rainy and snowy hikes have been the norm in recant days in the foot hills here. Got to the end of\u00a0Mad Max's Shortcut and turned right to Lilly lake headed up to the hiker's camp sites and set up camp, had some grub and chilled for a while then headed up to the Oyster Dome to catch the sunset, with small groups also joining coming and going with the sun going down quickly the hikers soon were thinning out except for just a few watching. The darkness soon took over the sky, the lights in the far distance from Anacortes and the\u00a0Refinery shimmered and looked very much like Christmas lights. After a bit headed back down\u00a0Beyond The Oyster Dome\u00a0Trail to Lily Lake, on our way we heard a very\u00a0close and loud owl letting its self be known of its presence maybe it didn't care for\u00a0our headlamps. Back at Lilly Lake camp had an awesome fire AKA \"camp TV\" with hundreds of frogs singing\u00a0 into the night. The moon was shinning through the trees lighting up small areas on the forest floor adding to the abeyance of our pleasant evening. In the afternoon when we packed up we hiked out on the Lily Lizard connector trail with the frogs still\u00a0serenading us down the trail. Headed up\u00a0North Butte for a gander then continued back down towards Lizard Lake. Took a little lunch break at Lizard and enjoyed the scenery,\u00a0also checking out the busy beavers handy\u00a0work on the trees around the lake. Filled up on some fresh\u00a0water coming down the small waterfall next to Lizard Lake\u00a0on the\u00a0British Army Trail. Left Lizard and headed to the Alternate Incline Trail, this trail has had a lot of fresh love given to it recently, improving\u00a0trail drainage and bringing the trail bed up to keep it out of the muck, while still leaving the old logging remnants where they had been left rusting away so many decades ago, I still enjoy seeing these trail markers in this area makes you appreciate the second growth we get to use that much more. After Alternate Incline at the end taking a right turn on BL-ML road took us back to the Upper parking lot ready to toss those packs off and having a seat felt pretty good.

I was up in Bellingham for the weekend was hoping for a good lake hike given that tall views would likely be obscured by the weather. No issues driving to the trailhead; some minor potholes, but that's it. Please note that the WTA driving directions take you to the Samish Overlook, but the WTA trail description has you starting at the Blanchard Mountain Trail Upper Trailhead, which is where I began (basically, when you see a yellow gate with signs indicating Samish Overlook on your drive over, continue straight instead of turning onto the road with the yellow gate). There were a few cars on this dreary afternoon, but the parking lot was nowhere near full.The WTA instructions are pretty clear about everything. Basically, follow signs for Lily & Lizard Lake; then follow signs for Lizard Lake when they diverge; then once you reach Lizard Lake, follow signs for Lily Lake; then get on Max's Shortcut and begin following signs to Upper Trailhead. The trails are all extremely well-marked.\u00a0I did, however, get a little confused at Lily Lake. Basically, at the campground, you'll see what looks like a small opening to the lake; go down there and a trail starts to the right of you. You'll go around the entire southern part of the lake. If you see signs for Oyster Dome or Oyster Lily Trail, don't follow them! Keep going around the lake. There will be a right turn to Max's Shortcut clearly marked.The trail was incredibly muddy and wet, and you have to cross a creek multiple times. Waterproof shoes and gaiters are highly recommended; you're going to be miserable if your feet aren't waterproof very quickly. Not a bit of snow to deal with.

The parking area is small but easy to locate by looking for the gravel driveway on your left after going under the freeway. You have to walk about .7 miles west from the parking area to get to the High Point trailhead for Grand Ridge and we were able to easily find it.\u00a0From this starting point, it's a moderate climb up and there are several switchbacks along the way. At the first junction, we decided to hike the Grand Ridge Trail to the Water Tower Loop, follow the loop, and return along the Grand Ridge Trail. Generally speaking, the trails are in pretty good shape. There is some standing water (and slush from the morning's snowfall)along the Water Tower Loop but there were no other issues with the trail condition. After the initial climb up the Grand Ridge Trail, the Water Tower Loop is mainly flat with some mild ups and downs. All in all, we had a nice walk in the woods in a beautiful area with a light dusting of fresh snow to everything look extra nice.\u00a0With that being said, I probably won't come back here to hike. This is also a popular mountain biking spot and during our hike, we encountered several groups of people mountain biking. Although most of them were courteous, we often were not made aware of their presence until we heard the squealing of their brakes as they came up behind us. The trail system is narrow in most places and if you are heading downhill and have a mountain biker come up behind you, it could quickly become an ugly situation if you do not have enough time to react.\u00a0I estimate that we hiked about 8 miles, including the roughly 1.4 mile round trip walk between the parking area and the actual trailhead.\u00a0", "date": "Mar 24, 2018"}, {"comment": "We came out to the trail today to do some improvement, and there were a ton of high school and college volunteers, which was awesome.

I left my trekking poles in the car for this one and while I could have used them, it was more of a leg workout without them. Surprise #2: There weren't as many people on the trail as I expected, which was nice. Perhaps everyone went out to further locations to embrace the chilly but sunny day. It's not to say there weren't others on the trail. Mostly mountain bikers and a few hikers, but not many. Most of the hike was in the silence of the trees. This is a beautiful forested rolling up and down hike for an urban area - it's hard to believe you are close to houses and the highway (though at times you can hear the traffic on I-90).

Despite the recent rainy weather the trail is in excellent shape with almost no muddy spots. Beyond the long Gap Creek Bridge there are quite a few trillium blooming right now. Keep your eyes open after the bridge as there are many impressive large Douglas firs, some showing evidence of fires from long ago.

I started at High Point parking lot and took the Nook Trail (lot of flowing streams and wet trail) up to the junction with with Talus and took a right. I then headed up to the left what is labeled an unmaintained trail, but is really the section line and is the steepest part of Tiger, I'd say. The roots were slick and there is lots of muddy areas, but nothing to bad. After the steep climb, I took a right onto Railroad Grade for some flat reprieve before the trail popped be out the the junction for Poo Poo Point when comign via high school. I'd only seen 2 people up til this point. I hiked down to Poo Poo Point and watched the paragliders for a bit and then hiked back to the intersection and went up the One View Trail. At the end of this, I took a right and kept going until I came to the split with a trail that is evading my memory but you head up and to the left... it's quite steep to start. This will pop you out onto the forest road but continue straight on the trail signed Poo Top. This ridge section is also quite steep at times. Eventually you end up at the Tiger 1 summit. Continue down and then to the left, toward Hiker's Hut, my favorite view on the mountain, though no Rainier yesterday. The peaks of the Olympics were just visible above the cloud layer.I headed down the road and then past the gate and up to Tiger 2 summit, and then down and over to the Tiger 3 summit.

Eventually, the trail became snow covered and it looked like snowshoe tracks that had been made days before. I kept on falling through onto the brush in my trail runners and didn't feel comfortable going on solo so I turned around. I would try again with a partner or when more snow melts out. I reached the Taylor River trail and headed towards Otter Falls. Don't miss the left turn to the falls - it's marked with a cairn and some pink tape. The falls were serene and there were only two others there. I headed back at 4:15 and reached my car at 5:15. The Taylor River trail is pretty uneventful\u00a0except for about 11 stream crossings - only 3 or 4 take a bit of manoeuvering.\u00a0What a fantastic day to be outside on this lovely trail! I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a beginning backpack - tons of great spots along the river to set up a tent.\u00a0", "date": "4 days ago"}, {"comment": "This was a lovely walk! constant peeks of the surrounding mountains which are plenty and snowcapped and are different then the usual lot you see from the highway. The Taylor river has a nice color to it. The trail is long but the falls are a worthwhile destination. Pink tape and patchy snow should indicate to you the left side spur to the falls around 4.7~ miles. We had them (the falls) to ourselves and saw about five other people on the trail on a sunny Tuesday.\u00a0I had to lie on the waterfall and get familiar.there are a few shallow creek crossing where some rock hopping is necessary.Countless white trillium regale you along. I have never seen trillium in the hundreds like that.", "date": "6 days ago"}, {"comment": "Grateful for April sunshine! The easy trail to Otter Falls was mostly snow-free until the last mile or so - I wore waterproof boots, but my hiking buddy was fine in his running shoes. No gaiters required. The many creeks crossing the trail were easily crossed.\u00a0Just a few folks at the falls/Lipsy Lake. My partner went for a VERY cold and VERY brief swim - I declined. This is a great early-season hike to break in your hiking legs. Do it now before the bugs and crowds.\u00a0Met a trail runner who had gone up toward Snoqualmie Lake but turned back 1/2 mile from the lake due to knee-deep post-holing and water running under the snow. Not her day to die. Snow shoes recommended if you're heading for the high lakes.As reported by many, there's a new-ish concrete barrier across the access road ~1/4 mile before the old trailhead, so add a little extra mileage to published hike distance.\u00a0", "date": "7 days ago"}],

The trail goes gently along an old road for most of the trail, but when it starts going up, it goes up very steeply, and it's super rocky, and fairly slippery.

It was wet but close to 50 degrees at the bottom so breathable rain gear is helpful on those soggy but not cold PNW days as you can work up a sweat hiking up.

The falls were absolutely incredible. It was pretty busy since I went on a Saturday but very worth it and everyone out there was very pleasant. Much cooler at the top so having a beanie or additional layer to put on is nice. My dog is a little over 60lbs and is about 7 years old.

I will try to include pictures.", "date": "2 days ago"}, {"comment": "We arrived at the luxurious paved parking area around 9:30 AM on a drizzly Saturday morning. Off and on showers were forecast but unfortunately, the showers were more \"on than off\" while we were hiking. To our surprise, ample parking was still available and the parking lot was only about a third full. The trailhead is very easy to find. The first .9 miles of the trail follows a decommissioned forest service road so it is wide and the grade is mostly flat. There is one junction along this section of the trail but it is well signed and easy to follow.\u00a0At the .9 mile mark, the trail begins to climb and becomes very rocky with lots of loose talus to negotiate. With the consistent drizzle, some spots along the route got tricky and definitely slowed our group down. The trail continues to climb through several switchbacks with varying amounts of loose rock all the way to the falls. The route through the rocks is fairly easy to find and follow, though it was helpful to have other people out on the trail to serve as a reference for where to go. The end of the trail is a bit anticlimatic because the trail just ends in a large dirt area with a view of the falls. The falls are beautiful and well worth the climb but there really isn't space for a lot of people at the viewpoint. Given the rain and the number of other groups at the viewpoint at the same time we were there, my group opted to only stay long enough for a few pictures and hike back to the parking lot.\u00a0With regards to maintenance, the trail is in pretty good shape. I only saw a few areas of mud along the way. However, I think this trail could use some brushing as there were several areas with overgrown tree branches hanging over the trail that I (as a tall individual) had a hard time avoiding. All in all, this turned out to be a great rainy day hike as the falls were roaring and the rain provided both crowd and dust control.\u00a0", "date": "2 days ago"}, {"comment": "The trail to Teneriffe Falls is a hidden gem and we're so glad we hiked it today. The TH parking lot is easy to find, paved and can accommodate many cars. The trail is in good condition and starts with a steady but easy climb on a wide and well-maintained trail.\u00a0 The trail then shifts to a rocky stretch with many switchbacks as you make your final ascent to the falls.\u00a0 The rocky part of the hike (roughly 1 mi) requires careful footing and can be slippery when wet, which it was today. The falls are quite breath-taking in their sheer height and water volume. You won't be disappointed! The falls produce quite a lot of mist making for wet conditions, so we could only stay a short time before heading back down.\u00a0 We stopped for lunch at a lovely spot at a lower and more tame portion of the falls.\u00a0 There were quite a few other hikers on the trail and finding room for passing, could be tricky in the rocky stretch due to narrowness of the path. \u00a0 The trail offers a number of territorial view opportunities, but it was too cloudy and rainy for us to see much. \u00a0 We'll be back on a clearer day to enjoy those views.\u00a0 This is a great hike and we plan to come back again and again.", "date": "2 days ago"}],

"comments":[{"comment": "On day one of a two-night backpacking trip, we (party of two) hiked the Jackita Ridge trail up to the McMillan park and found a good backcountry tent site for the night. The hike to the turnoff to McMillan, as opposed to continuing to Crater lake, was four miles from the trailhead and took us well over three hours (average speed is 2 miles an hour).  The trail was in good condition but with several trees that we needed to climb over (there was a WTA crew clearing debris on our hike out, so that might be all cleared by now). The climb up is steep (at least 50 switchbacks) which slowed us down a bit. At the junction there's one large campsite and a weak stream for water, but that's the last moving water for at least a mile toward Devil's park. There is a better stream about half a mile back from there on your climb up the ridge, which would be an ideal place to fill up if you're planning to stop at the junction or a bit past. \r There were about 4 other parties in backcountry sites along that stretch but we had no trouble finding a spot. The site we chose was 25 minutes from the junction and on the right-hand side of the trail, and surrounded by wild blueberries, which we added to both our desserts and breakfasts. We've fondly named the spot Marshleberry camp in honor of the terrain and delicacy. \r One day two, we backtracked to the junction and turned toward Crater Lake to hike Lookout 1. There was one party camped at Crater Lake site (really good site, about fifty yards before you get to the lake) and one more on the banks of the lake, which was more of a shallow pond so don't get hopes up for an afternoon swim. We didn't make it the final quarter mile or so to the true summit given we weren't up for a scramble (we did speak with one hiker who had done it, saying the way was fairly well marked with cairns and x's, but that it was a little tough to follow). Instead we enjoyed a lovely lunch overlooking several peaks and Mt. Baker. \r On the way down, we stopped at the Crater lake campsite to fill our water as there's a great stream running on the far side (you have to leave the trail and walk through the campsite to find it). This was the best water source we had on the trip. We saw several more hikers arriving that evening and water was on most people's minds.\r One day three we packed up and hiked out, taking us about 2.5 hours for the descent to the Canyon Creek trailhead. By today, the smoke from the Diamond Creek fire had settled on the ridge and was blocking pretty much all visibility so before to check forecasts before you go - would be a shame to do all of that climbing to not see anything at the top. \r In brief:\rSo many switchbacks\rGreat view; almost at the top\rBlueberries for days", "date": "Sep 2, 2017"}, {"comment": "Hiked in to Crater Lake and on to Crater Mountain via the Jackita Ridge trail. \u00a0The Jackita trail is in fine shape with only minor blowdowns until the unsigned junction for Crater Lake. \u00a0Some narrow areas on the trail just beyond the bridge about a half mile in but nothing bad. \u00a0More smaller blowdowns on the way to Crater Lake but nothing difficult to step over or around.Hiked up to Crater Lookout #2 first. \u00a0That trail is a bit faint at the start but gets better as you go along. \u00a0Some minor blowdowns again but nothing bad. \u00a0Keep your eyes peeled for cairns in a few places to marked faded switchbacks. \u00a0Views from the old lookout site are very good! \u00a0Great views across the rest of the ridge, to Devil's Dome, and Jack Mountain. \u00a0Pretty glacial blue lake below. \u00a0Watch for broken glass and nails around the lookout remnants.Dropped back to Crater Lake and then on to the main summit. \u00a0Good trail until about 7600 ft, then it disappears into a loose gully. \u00a0Paint markings tempt one up this gully. \u00a0I followed the markings up. \u00a0It starts off well enough but higher up becomes quite steep with loose pebbles. \u00a0On the descent I found a better route is to traverse across this gully and around the corner. \u00a0You will spot cairns leading upwards. \u00a0This is still steep but offers better footing and less loose rock. \u00a0Higher up the routes converge and one has to negotiate a series of ledges, similar to the narrow spot on Mt Pugh. \u00a0It can be intimidating in places but is better than the gully you've already ascended. \u00a0If you see a yellow arrow it gets far better beyond this last step. \u00a0The final bit is once again good trail to the summit. \u00a0Grand views at the top! \u00a0There is a register tube with a laminated info card about Jack Kerouac and the old lookout tender but no register notebook or pencil inside.Descended the other route as I mentioned above. \u00a0Far better than the gully. \u00a0Camped above the lake and it was surprisingly cold with a strong breeze. \u00a0Kept the bugs away at least.", "date": "Aug 19, 2017"}, {"comment": "I hiked the Devils Dome loop as a solo-backpacking trip over three days. I originally intended it as a four day, three-night trip but went a little faster than planned. The weather forecast was for hot weather, approaching 100 degrees towards the end of my time. I didn\u2019t find that the heat was really a problem though as it was a little cooler in the hills than in the low country.Day one\u2019s intended destination was Devil\u2019s Park. Started from the Canyon Creek trailhead off of HWY 20 at 7 am, hoping to avoid the heat of the day. The trail was easy to follow although a bit rough in spots. This trail is not maintained by the forest service but the \u201croughness\u201d mostly means that the trail is overgrown and crowded in spots. Most of the overgrown portions only come up to the knees however so it did not impede travel much at all. You do consistently gain elevation so expect to earn your miles. While not exceedingly steep, there is no mistaking that you are heading uphill quickly.The first bit of navigation comes with the intersection of the Jackita Ridge trail and the branch off to Crater Mt. As others have noted, this intersection is not marked and the most obvious trail is the one that leads to Crater Mt. I went about 20 yards down this trail before I got the feeling that I had missed something. I backtracked to the creek and sure enough, found the right trail leading off on the other side of the creek. The trail is clear but unless you actually go down to the water and look for it, you may miss it.Once you gain the ridge and enter McMillans Park, the beauty of the area really comes alive. You begin to see the mountains and the flowers in the alpine meadows. This is what you hike this trail for. After the steady up hill of the first several miles it feels good to pass through this relatively flat area. There are a lot of mosquitos in this area however so I kept moving to avoid being eaten alive.I reached the Devils Park shelter at roughly noon. I spent about 40 minutes resting and checking out this area. There is a good water source and the flowers are abundant. I ultimately decided not to stay here for the night, just because I had so much day left. The next several miles of trail gain elevation and take you on to Jackita Ridge. The views continually get better and open up more of the cascades for your viewing pleasure.\u00a0The next several miles are a pleasure to hike. The main difficult spot was the scree field. It is a steep downhill with very loose rock. This area is a slow down no matter how you approach it.I decided that I was going to try to reach Devils Pass for the night and if I had enough daylight, Devils Dome. Unfortunately the last two miles before Devils Pass are hellish when tackled at the end of the day. It is a very steep, rough downhill and equally steep uphill on the other side. There was a beautiful campsite two miles before Devils Pass and I wish I had stayed there. I reached Devils Pass after 17.5 miles and over 7K of elevation gain and almost 4K of elevation loss. The bugs were really bad and I spent any time before sleep in my tent to avoid them. I did not find any water near Devils Pass but water had been plentiful throughout the day so I had plenty.Day 2 started at 6 and I was on the trail by 7. The 4 miles or so to Devils Dome are very pretty and the trail takes you right to the edge of some serious drop offs. The trail never feels unsafe but you definitely want to pay attention. Reached Devils dome just after 8. I definitely want to come back in the future and camp a night on top. It has many spots to drop a tent and affords 360 degree views of the cascades.I spent about 35 minutes on top before heading down the trail. There is a water source just a little ways down from the dome that should be consistent throughout the summer.The trip down to the valley is a fairly gradual downhill, in fact I wondered at times if I was ever going to get down to the lake. You eventually do though. The views of Jack Mt. continue to change throughout the hike until you eventually say goodbye for good and drop in to the lower trees.I reached my destination of Rainbow Point campground sometime around 4. The trail to the camp takes you right along Ross Lake and is very nice. A totally different view than the mountains but a nice change. The path at times is cut right out of the rock and is really spectacular. The campground is really nice with three sites that each has two tent sites. I took a swim in the lake and just spent some time relaxing and reading. There were virtually no bugs to speak of which was a welcome change. The temperature in the valley was much warmer than in the hills so it was a very hot sleep.I hit the trail at 6 the next morning, hoping to be back to the car before noon. The East Bank trail is very flat so I was able make very good time. Most of the trail is through forest so there wasn\u2019t a whole lot of incentive to go slow. The bugs were back once you got a way from the lake so beware. The only elevation gain is over hidden hand pass but it is a very gradual gain and loss.The worst part of the whole trail was the last mile. From the East Bank trailhead you follow the river, which is beautiful, to the canyon creek trailhead. There is a sign at one point that says this 2.5 miles is maintained by the Skagit Audubon club but I am guessing that they haven\u2019t had a trail day in a while. There are multiple downed trees crossing the trail that you have to fight through. This is one top of crossing through boulders and brush so thick you just have to trust that you are on the trail. Not fun. All good, and bad, things come to an end though and it was a great feeling to see the footbridge signifying the return to where I started.Overall this is a great trail. Lots of views. Plenty of camping options for whatever length of days you want to hike.", "date": "Jul 30, 2017"}, {"comment": "I went to the Marblemount ranger station the day before our trip at 7:30am, a half hour before they opened, to secure our overnight permits for Desolation camp and Devils creek camp along Ross lake. (I had wanted devils junction camp but it was already taken). It was lucky I got there extra early because there is only 1 campsite available at Desolation and someone showed up 20 minutes after me hoping to get the same permit. I highly recommend getting your permits early!We had reserved the Ross lake water taxi a few days earlier in the week which would cut off 18 miles of hiking\u00a0and were all set to take it to Desolation dock leaving at 9:30am on Thursday. We drove 2 cars Thursday morning leaving Lake Stevens at 6am. We parked one car at the Canyon creek trailhead and one car at the Ross lake dam trailhead. This would save us 9 miles since we were taking the water taxi and needed to park at the Ross lake dam trailhead instead of the East bank trailhead where most people park for the Devils dome loop. We hiked down the 1.5 mile Ross lake dam trail to the Ross resort phone and got there a half hour early at 9am. The boat arrived exactly at 9:30 and after a quick 30-45 mins or so we were at Desolation dock. The boat ride is $130 one way and we split the cost with another group that had made the same reservation.The trail up to Desolation is really well graded. It was very hot out so we took our time and enjoyed the wildflowers which were everywhere. There is only 1 small stream about halfway to the campsite to get water from and it probably disappears later in the year. Bring lots of water! The campsite is melted out and\u00a0shaded with a very nice view overlooking Ross lake if you walk out a few feet. We set up our tents at camp and napped to wait out the hotter part of the day before heading up to the Desolation peak lookout. There are a few snow patches near the summit but they are easy to boot across. There was a very friendly ranger staying in the lookout. He showed us around the lookout, told us about the history and shared some of his melted snow/water with us. Note: the snow is melting fast up there and you will probably only be able to melt snow for water on the summit for another couple weeks. Again, bring lots of water!We weren\u2019t bothered by any bugs until around 8pm and then they came out in full force. They hung around until about 9am the next day. The sunrise was beautiful from the desolation campsite. We broke down camp the next day and started back down the trail and along the East bank trail to devils creek campsite. Although this day had\u00a0minimal elevation gain it felt like the hardest day because it was so hot down low! A 90 degree day. There was no one camping at the lightning creek stock camp so we took advantage of the really nice shoreline there to swim for a couple hours. The water was a nice temperature and there are hundreds of small 1-2 inch fish in the\u00a0lake along the shoreline. They nibbled lightly at our feet and legs as we swam.\u00a0It took us all day to go 10 miles to devils creek in the heat. There are 3 campsites and only 1 of them is really nice and overlooks the lake. We got there too late to get it. The access down to the lake isn\u2019t that great either. It\u2019s very rocky and there isn\u2019t much of shoreline. Lightening creek stock camp was much nicer. It also gets windy in the afternoon so we were glad we swam earlier.\u00a0The bugs weren\u2019t too bad though.The 3rd day we woke up early and started up the Devils dome trail. The 5000ft of gain was also really well graded although the trail became really overgrown in places and there were lots of blowdowns to hop over. Wildflowers of all sorts were all over the place! There are lots of creeks to get water from and a few creeks and melted out tarns just below the devils dome summit. We didn\u2019t see anyone the whole day and no one else was camping on the dome, not even the mosquitos! We got a really nice melted out campsite with a rock shelter on the summit. There are other flat campsites around the dome but they are all snow covered. We considered going up Bear Skull peak which had some snow but looked really easy but decided against it because of the heat. Instead we lounged around enjoying the flowers and the view.We started early again the next day, our longest mileage day, down devils dome,\u00a0over\u00a0jackita ridge to devils shelter. There were a few snow patches to cross but we could boot across them and we were able to stay on trail the whole time although it was overgrown in places. Be prepared for lots of ups and downs along jackita ridge. There is only 1 short steep 15ft snowy section to traverse\u00a0on the last part of\u00a0jackita ridge where our ice axes and microspikes came in handy. If you were going the opposite way and got to this section in the afternoon you could probably just glissade down it. There were 3 other groups that had gone on this section before us though going the opposite direction and they had kicked in really nice steps.No one was camping at devils shelter when we got there. The best campsites are about .25 miles before or after the shelter. The camping at the actual shelter isn\u2019t that great. The bugs were really bad here but we were able to have a campfire which kept some of them away.We had\u00a0a leisurely morning the next day and started down to the canyon creek trail around 8am. We had considered doing\u00a0Crater mtn but decided to save it for later in the season.\u00a0The canyon creek\u00a0trail\u00a0was also\u00a0really overgrown in places. The creek crossing on the canyon creek trail looked like it was raging so we switched into camp shoes (croc swiftwater sandals). We went nice and slow and it wasn\u2019t nearly as bad as it looked. We found some wild strawberries on the trail back down, at first for me!

To avoid the mud many users of the trail walk around and create short, parallel trails, sometimes several of them. On one unoffical side trail I saw the main trail brach into six paralell trails in a meadow creating an ugly swath. At some point this had to stop. My planned route was up the Remmel Lake trail, along the Boundary trail, and complete a circle around Sheep Mountain. On the first day it alternated between rain and hail about 8 or 9 times, and once is snowed, just as I passed Remmel Lake. I planned on hiking 30 miles the first day and camp at Sheep Lake. On the way up to Sheep Lake I lost the trail, but it was a short distance more up to the lake(if using a Green Trail Map, the 0.6 mile section nearing Sheep Lake is were I lost the trail). It was cold and windy at the lake, and I woke in the morning to find my shoes and socks had frozed over. The second day I took a 0.7 mile side trail signed \"\"Devil's Staircase,\"\" to a ridge of Sheep Mountain. Great views! Then I did the circit around Sheep Mountain, and I was amazed by the large meadows/park land, wild flowers, and views of the peaks of the Pasayden Wilderness.", "date": "11 days ago"}, {"comment": "See additional links below for more trip photos.Logistics overviewRead more...Access: Cathedral Driveway TrailheadGear: none", "date": "Sep 4, 2017"}, {"comment": "Took a week to complete this beautiful loop.

It was dry as can be there. We also ran into Customs and Border Patrol trainees, about 25 of them. They are already patrolling the boundary trail in the eastern Pasayten, so they are no doubt going to start on this section once it's logged out fully.\u00a0After the decent, the Trail down to Ross Lake is in great shape, and it's a nice quiet corner of the park. We hit the lake and were overwhelmed by the boating campground scene so we stayed briefly and got back to the car early.\u00a0We are hoping that CBP and others that explore this area are respectful and use no trace camping techniques. It's been a remote area during the years of deferred maintenance on the trail and unlike the bombed out camps along the PCT, this area got a rest.

Got some helpful advice from the Park Service ranger at the Hart's pass campground.  \r Right off the trailhead, the path climbs to the top of the ridge (about 7000 ft), then quickly loses maybe 500 feet on the other side.  After that, it's mainly flat until just before the lake, but with a few fairly gentle ups-and-downs.  Some nice late-season wildflowers, and a few patches of the very tasty ground cover-type blueberries.\r The only major trail obstacle of note were the fallen trees.  There were a couple small ones around the halfway point which should not have been a big deal, but I slipped on one and scraped my knee.  A set of two fallen trees on the descent to the lake were more of an obstacle, and required some contorting to get around.\r Even on a summer Saturday, we were the only campers on the lake.  Mother Nature was helping to enforce the \"don't camp next to lakes\" rule with a very brisk wind coming down off the ridge, so we camped at a site further inland.  Fortunately fires were allowed in the area at the time, so we got a nice campfire going (the area didn't look too try, fortunately).  Swatted a few mosquitoes but got maybe only one bite.  It got fairly cold overnight - maybe down to 40.  The wind did let up a little overnight, which helped out.\r The trip out was uneventful, and seemed a little easier despite more climbing (the TH is higher than the lake).  Maybe our bodies made a little progress in acclimating to the higher elevation.  \r Overall, nice hike in a pleasant region we hadn't explored before, and this was a good spot to get away from the crowds (after the National Park rangers telling us basically every spot in the park was full).

Soaking wet brush made me wish I'd packed gaiters. The trail across Buckskin was easy to follow and mileage accurate to Silver Lake. The lake was decent enough. Continuing past the lake the trail was considerably rougher and not always where USGS or Greentrails indicated. At one point, beyond Silver Pass, it drops far into the valley, goes down a bit,then climbs straight back up. Some blow down and difficult places to follow approaching Buckskin Lake but overall not bad. The signed and mapped mileage claimed 10 miles, I recorded 12.5. Buckskin Lake was a decent place to stay and I had it all to myself. One tragedy: I'd forgotten my spoon! Second time this year. I did remember that episode of McGuyver where he goes camping and forgets his spoon so I was able to cup up my beer can for a make-shift option. Overnight all the clouds blew away leaving a great star show.\r Recorded 12.5 miles with 3200ft gain. Some good trail, mostly rough trail.\r In the morning I debated a quick trip up to Buckskin Point but opted to just hike out since I was unsure if the mileage had any more surprises. Happily it was smooth sailing down to the river trail. At the Tatoosh Butte trail junction I found a sign indicating a washout ahead, the first I'd heard of. I went back down the trail aways to a marked cabin site to see if I could find anyone with more information but instead just found a flattened old cabin. Thankfully the washout was easily bypassed on foot.\r On the other side the trail was still easy to follow until Lease Creek where it entered an old burn. Most of the blowdown had been cleared but it was quite brushy until I climbed up above the burn, then easy going. Fanastic walking through high meadows along the ridge where I left the trail and went to the top of Tatoosh Buttes. Great place! I stayed up here a bit then took a lower route across Tamarack Ridge looking for water. I found a pretty smalll but clear stream and refilled before moving on to Ptarmigan. Easy walking to the top of a faint path but the length of the day was catching up with me now.\r Views from Ptarmigan were great in all directions! Well worth the two days to get here. I looked for a register but didn't find one. I had planned to drop down to Dot Lakes for the night but instead opted to make camp near the little tarn on the ridge. It let me have a high camp, still get Dot Peak and visit the lakes, and have a better view of the Perseids. Only downside would be a very cold night though I could live with that.\r I lounged around a few hours until sunset, watched a great colorful show, and turned in early. I set a 1 am alarm and woke to great stars and another night with faintly visible green from the northern lights. Perseids were going strong, the best show I'd ever seen.\r Recorded 16 miles with 4950ft gain. Mix of good trail, bad trail, and off-trail.\r In the morning I packed up and made a quick visit to Dot Mountain. Nice little peak! I had considered going through the col between Lago and Carru but I couldn't see a snow-free path. Going across in the early morning without snow travel gear was definitely a no-go. So instead I descended to Dot Lakes. Really beautiful lakes! So many larch. I saw a tent here, the first sign of a person since I started my trip, but no sign of its occupant.\r I refilled my water and began the long traverse out towards Butte Pass. I knew not to drop down to the Ptarmigan Creek trail. Every report of this one without fail mentioned it as an overgrown and unlogged misery slog. By comparison staying along the hillside wasn't bad. Some talus hopping, some meadow travel between sparse larch, and so on. Crossing the shoulder of Lago through a steep but treed gully wasn't terribly fun but worked. On the far side I opted to go higher onto the ridge rather than keep going out to Butte Pass. This worked though it did go through some steep dirt and rock ledges that were not pleasant. In hindsight just continuing the traverse out to Butte Pass would have been easier.\r Over Butte Pass I dropped down on trail and found a very nice tarn in the basin! Far too shallow to swim but very pretty. I had lunch here, soaked my feet, and eventually moved on to Shellrock pass. Emphasis on \"rock\". The trail faded in and out in the meadows but the higher parts were all fist-sized rocks. Views from the pass were nice though.\r Now it was once again down into another valley on rough trail. Easy to follow but rough, a bit overgrown, and some blowdown to make things interesting. Eventually I climbed back up towards Doris Lake on improving trail. I reached the lake a bit before 5pm, claimed a nice campsite, and called it a day. The lake was very pretty and just warm enough for a swim! The rest of the evening I just lounged around with my book. I saw one hiker go past into the higher campsites but no sign of the other occupants of the bigger tent.\r Overnight the clouds again blew away for one last great star show. It was also again colder than forecast and I really wished I'd taken the weight penalty to bring my 10 degree sleeping bag.\r Recorded 10.2 miles and 3800ft gain. About half off-trail, the rest crummy trail.\r Up reasonably early I decided to skip Osceola for a return trip and began the long hike back to Slate Pass. Somewhat rough and steep down to pretty Fred Lake and down to the main river trail. Then easy, fast, smooth sailing all the way back. Be warned many of the junctions are poorly signed and one major junction simply goes down to a massive horse-camp on the river. I crossed paths with several large groups heading into the cabin at the Pasayten airfield. I think it was a WTA volunteer vacation. They said nobody camps in the cabin due to mice but stay nearby and use its facilities.\r On my hike in I had no views from Slate Pass, now I had great blue skies! There was also a Forest Service pickup at the trailhead and a sign with information on the washout. Also cars parked in every single wide spot of the road. Popular place! I made the slow drive down the road and thankfully didn't meet another car coming across Deadhorse Point. Bought a great sandwich at the Mazama Store and a beer, drove up the highway to eat these at the Diablo Overlook, then the long drive back home.\r 12.2 miles with 2450 gain on the way out, almost all on very good trail for speedy travel.\r What a great area! I'll definitely be back.", "date": "Aug 10, 2016"}, {"comment": "Trail finding skills needed. This is a fairly arduous hike that dumps you out at the Middle Fork Pasayten Trail.

After all, the map & signs say it is only 10 miles all within the elevation range of 5800' to 7300'. I dismissed prior trip reports that complained of the actual trail being different than Green Trails map and longer than is officially documented. From my own GPS track, the trail to Buckskin Lake is closer to 14 miles with total ascent (or descent depending on direction) of 4600'. But then add the extra effort of getting around all the blow downs (mostly after Silver Lake), and I was beat after each day of hiking. But, the trail offered great solitude, plenty of flowers (and bugs) and nice high elevation scenery of the Pasayten Wilderness. \r Details: \rAfter camping at Harts Pass and expectations of an easy hike, I was in no hurry to get on the trail - 9:45am. I met the only people of the day (a family of 4) within 15 minutes. The section of trail to Silver Lake is in pretty good shape with only an occasional blow down. Flowers & scenery was very nice too. I actually bypassed the spur to Silver Lake, purposely saving it for the return trip, however the triangular intersection had no signage. Crossing Silver Creek was no problem however on the way to Silver Pass there is a major blow down of several trees with no good/clear bypass established yet. But sometimes it is just the lone blow down at just the right height that can cause me to be \"rolling in the dirt\". At Silver Pass, there are spurs heading in each direction of the ridge but the main trail goes right up and over the pass. After Silver Pass, there is a quick descent, a nice meadow section and then right back up steep switchbacks in an avalanche shoot (,which is labelled \"Steep and Dangerous\" on Green Trails map presumably for stock). There is very little of the trail that is level. You are either going up or down most of the time. After traversing Buckskin ridge for a while, the trail turns east for the high point (7300') crossing over the ridge. Both my USGS Topo and Green Trails (1997), show a nice smooth meandering trail rather than the actual trail that thankfully have switchbacks to cut the grade. At no point did I feel that I should go off trail to follow the map, I just told myself to following where the trail leads me (because it was always going in the right general direction). And I never felt in danger of losing the trail either. Just over the high point & now after 6pm, I decided to make camp by a few tarns with a great view of Osceola Peak (spotlit at sunset). \rDay 2 - Early start - before 6am. I decided to try to make it to Buckskin Lake while the tent was drying in the sun. I made it thru another bad section of blow downs (this one with a flagged bypass route thru a swampy area) and came within 1/3 mile of the lake before deciding that I better turn back. Once back at camp, I discovered that I didn't turn the stove off completely the night before and had no fuel left for coffee. Wah! All packed up now, I hit the trail at 8am for the return trip which was nice because I knew what to expect - blow downs, steep spots, views. Silver Lake, and the only other human encounter, was nice. A Bald Eagle did a fly over. I took the pack off Bandit, the crazy dog, so he could swim. The rest of the way back was nice and the weather couldn't have been better - 80s and not too cold at night with a few clouds rolling in each afternoon. We got to the TH just after 6pm.", "date": "Jul 26, 2016"}],

Soon, it was time for a little walk up the road and then the long descent of this inverted hike.  The hike down to the pass below Slate Peak had great views of the headwater basin of the Middle Fork, and lots of flowers at their peak.  At the pass was the grand view of the West Fork valley and the peaked ridges on each side.\r The initial descent into the valley crosses 5 snowfields, some steep, but two of them can be bypassed on a path below them.  Boots and poles were nice to have to kick steps and balance.  Once below the snowfields, the trail starts its long traverse below Gold Ridge.  This crosses many steep meadows with flowers in bloom and goes below a number of mine sites.  \r The first of 17 logs to get around/over before reaching the river start in this section.  The logs before the ford pose a minor difficulty for hikers and stop stock.  We met a backpacker who made it a ways beyond Holman Cr before aborting a 5 day trip due to mass of logs over the trail in the valley.\r After the long traverse, the trail turned more directly downhill and became much more eroded and overgrown.  The old boardwalks have been removed and consequently the trail has long muddy sections.  We took a lunch break at the first campsite along the river at 3.9 miles.  Shortly after stopping, it was definitely time for bug repellant due to the mosquitos and biting flies.  After the break, we continued slowly down the trail, due to all the logs and mud.\r We passed the campsite at 4.5 miles and decided to turn around at the ford for the West Fork Pasayten at 4.7 miles on the trail (5 miles from the car).  The ford is mostly a rock hop, with a few splash steps on the western side.  There is a single log crossing for those with very good balance.\r After a short break, it was time to \"Pay the Piper\" and start the long climb back to the car.  Along the way, we unable locate the junction with Trail #576, but that trail appears to be abandoned.  We were both glad when we reached the pass, since almost all the climbing was done.", "date": "Jul 24, 2016"}, {"comment": "", "date": "Jul 19, 2011"}, {"comment": "", "date": "Aug 26, 2010"}, {"comment": "", "date": "Sep 21, 2009"}, {"comment": "We did a very nice 4 day 40 mile loop north of Harts Pass.

Day 2 We left the PCT at Holman Pass and descended Holman Creek and the West fork the of Pasayten River. The trail has been logged out but is not heavily used. There is grass growing in the tread in places. We made good time to a nice campsite in the woods at the Rock Creek bridge. Once we left the PCT we saw only 1 other party, a horse packer hurrying in to pick someone upDay 3 We ascended the trail to Buckskin lake. There are 30+ blowdowns on the trail which may be a benefit as they keep reduce the traffic to Buckskin Lake. We saw no other parties the entire day. The lake is a gem with extensive meadows above it full of flowers. I'd never seen white lousewort growing in huge billows as if it were lupine. Day 4 The trail south from Buckskin lake is sketchy in places and much more strenuous than it's nominal 3.1 miles would indicate. The views and flowers were great. At Silver Pass the trail becomes well used and much easier. We walked the final miles back to Slate Pass trough more wildflowers.", "date": "Aug 9, 2008"}],

Sadly, there is no portapotty.\u00a0The triliums are fading. Fringe cups, bleeding hearts and false solomon's seal are blooming,the twisted stalks are in bud. Service berry, cherry trees, and big leaf maple (edible flowers) all are blooming as are miner's lettuce, (edible) dandelion blossoms. Buttercups are in bud. Had a look for corydalis, but didn't see that yet.We enjoyed reading the historical signs about the huge coal mining activity.

It was mushy and I postholed up to my knees frequently. I had my poles, gaiters, and microspikes. I also carried my ice axe just in case but didn\u2019t ever need to pull it out. The spikes were minimally useful on the mush, but more helpful in the shade of the trees where the snow was harder.The ridgeline felt never ending. The trail dips into the trees and became a little hard to follow as tracks were not as obvious, but it wasn\u2019t too bad. Finally I cleared the last trees and made the summit. It was a stunning day at the top.

A few stream crossings that were easy to cross and stay dry thanks to stepping stones or just a big step/jump. Snow started around 4+/5 miles. It was still cool enough to walk on without plunge stepping. Some stream crossings that were made difficult only because I had dogs eager to keep pushing forward and the cut of the water meant a steep two feet of snow down to the stream and back up. We turned around about 1/4 mile in to the snow-- not because it was difficult travel but because I was nervous about the descent with dogs pulling me down hill (see photos for an idea of amount of snow/sled dogs). I had microspikes and would have put them on had we continued up. Brought gaiters but didn't need them. Ran in to a few more folks on the way back down and only saw crowds once we passed the junction to the waterfalls. Got back to the trailhead and there were still plenty of open parking spots. (For context, as we passed Mt Si lot on the way out all the spots were full, including along the road and overflow lots.)", "date": "9 days ago"}, {"comment": "Did a full\u00a0loop tour of Teneriffe and Si. Were unsure whether our route would be doable due to snow conditions, but luckily with the right snow gear all the routes are accessible.\u00a0We started from the Mount Teneriffe parking lot\u00a0around 10 am and I'll say that this is the nicest hike parking lot I have ever seen. Well done WTA!Our first destination was Teneriffe Falls, via the Teneriffe Falls trail. This is a pretty straightforward (signed) hike to a stunning waterfall. The trip to the upper falls is rocky and can be pretty slick, so caution strongly advised. We did see dads carrying babies on their backs on the way up, so take that for what it's worth.After hitting the falls we cut up the Kamikaze trail to Mount Teneriffe. This trail drastically cuts down on the time/distance needed to get to Teneriffe summit, though at the expense of travelling straight up the side of the mountain. There are no switchbacks and you gain >2000 feet very quickly. The trail is primarily a bootpath, and should only be attempted by conditioned, experienced hikers. About a mile from the top, the snow kicks in and either microspikes or poles are necessary here, if not both. We saw people attempting to come down this way without spikes and they were slipping and sliding all over the place. The snow is also exceptionally slushy in parts, and without proper footgear and gaiters, your feet will be soaked.The summit of Teneriffe is completely covered in snow. There is a very large cornice at the very top\u00a0and it is hard to tell how sheer the drop is, so\u00a0STAY AWAY FROM THE EDGE.\u00a0After hitting the summit, we backtracked a bit to find the remnants of footsteps leading off along the\u00a0Teneriffe Trail which takes you over to Si. We followed the footprints (only losing them a few times) before they became more pronounced and we knew we were on the right track. It's important to note that new snowfall here could completely erase the trail and cause routefinding to be required.We had a blast on this section of the hike, which is a few miles of mostly light descent, but completely snow covered. A GPS and/or map is crucial here, as there are a few junctions along the way which are necessary to take and hard to define here. We soon reached the Si/Teneriffe Connector trail and shortly after Mount Si itself. By the time we hit the connector it was snowing pretty heavily, but oddly enough the snow on the summit of Si had completely melted.Finally we descended Si (as brutal as always on the knees), arrived at the parking lot, and completed the loop by walking along the road for a ways back to the Teneriffe lot.This was an amazing hike, recommended by a previous trail report, but I would only recommend this for experienced hikers wanting to make a full day of it.

We took out poles which were super helpful.Traction wasn't needed since the snow was fluffy, but up high snowshoes would have been nice since the trail wasn't really packed down and we were postholing quite a bit. Be careful, since the snow is definitely several feet deep, especially the trail down to the lakes, and we saw some holes which were at least a 5 foot drop down.

The snow was soft on the way up and mushy on the way back. It had noticeably melted, adding to the water roar of Granite Creek on the way back. We got within \u00bd mile of Upper Granite Lake and had to stop due to post-holing sometimes up to waist deep. The group ate lunch in the flat open area above the lake and headed back.\u00a0As it warms up and the snow continues to melt, the stream crossing that's after the trail split to Thompson Lake may be ankle deep or more.

We parked at the Trail of Two Forests parking lot as its closed at this point.\u00a0First we explored \"Lake Cave\" which is found about a 1/4 mile from the parking lot of the Trail of Two Forests parking lot. To find this cave, observe the bathroom and follow the trail leaving just to the left. Follow this trail until you find an obvious sink-hole right in front of you where the lava tube collapsed. This sink-hole will give you access to the cave.\u00a0It's hard to gauge given the fact that GPS doesn't work and step counters on phones are not the most accurate, but I believe this cave lasts about a mile. The initial entrance to the cave is a low crouch and you'll pass an incredible glass-basalt rock with ripples where the lava cooled. After this rock you'll be able to stand as you walk deeper. From here you'll descend a metal ladder to the floor of the cave.Another quarter mile or so and you'll find another obstruction which requires a very short downclimbing section\u00a0 through a small hole that isn't wide enough for you to have a backpack on. After this obstruction its pretty easy going as the cave gets smaller and smaller.\u00a0You will rarely find another person here.After this cave we hiked the mile along the closed road to Ape Cave. The road is mostly snow right now, but the lower entrance to Ape Cave is free of snow. We didn't venture to the upper entrance, but I would assume given the amount of snow at the lower entrance that there is likely a lot of snow there.\u00a0Lots of people at Ape Cave and for good reason. Wear clothes you don't mind getting dirty and keep in mind that no matter the weather the caves have a ton of moisture inside and pretty much always drip.

Very pleasant but feels longer than 5 miles.", "date": "today"}, {"comment": "I arrived at the trailhead at 8:15, after spending an extra half hour trying to get onto I-90 at Rainier. So much for missing the morning rush hour.I've heretofore avoided most Squak/Cougar/Tiger Mountain trails in favor of Snoqualmie, mostly because of my stereotypes about the Eastside (as a lifelong Seattleite). The sheer number of crisscrossing trails, plus the proximity to Issaquah, meant I fully expected to see swarms of moms pushing all-terrain strollers, be mowed down from behind by mountain bikers, or, even worse, to turn a corner and see the ginormous homes of some horrific new \"highlands\" housing development. I also expected the mountain to be over-logged and the trees not much thicker than my skinny arms, dwarfed by a forest of radio towers in a sea of clear-cuts.But alas, the snow's still melting on Snoqualmie trails and I didn't feel like slipping and sliding so\u00a0I needed to find something\u00a0under 2000 feet. I pulled up my trusty spreadsheet of 3000 trails I'll never get to and found Margaret's Way. It was on Squak, which seemed the lesser of three evils. Plus, I hike with my dog, and I don't know about you but \"Cougar\" and \"Tiger\" sound pretty ominous, and I don't want my pup to be a snack for some habitat-deprived mountain lion heading down to the suburbs to hunt for latchkey children whose parents are away at Microsoft. Squak sounds safe. What's the worst animal that squawks? One could argue that an eagle squawks and is probably just as dangerous as a tiger or a cougar, but I prefer to think turkey or goose.Aaaaaanyway, about the trail. The first half mile is a nightmare, at least by my idealistic trail standards. First, it's pure gravel, which is no fun to walk on. Second, and even more jarring, were the sounds from the Flintstone-esque rock quarry next door, which varied between a massive jackhammer, train brakes squealing, and trucks reverse-beeping. Fine if you're making industrial music, but not if you're trying to find some peace and quiet out in nature.But after the first half mile and a little grove of aspen-like trees the human sounds fade away and the forest sounds take over. The trees aren't exactly old-growth but they're big enough to make you feel like you're in the woods, even though you could probably still throw a stone and hit a Starbucks somewhere down below. The housing developments are probably in there somewhere but I didn't see any, and though the trail itself isn't terribly exciting the payoff is pretty nice at Debbie's Viewpoint, in terms of a spot to eat lunch and enjoy the view before heading back.\u00a0There seems to be some question about the real length of this trail, judging from some other trail reports and the trail sign itself, which has been defaced with several \"alternative facts\" about the distance back to the trailhead. By my app it was 3.27 miles to the Chybinski junction and another .3 miles to Debbie's View. Gain/Highest elevation was consistent with the 1500/1730 on the WTA page.I didn't see anyone on the trail going up, but saw about 15 on the way down (though they came mostly in two's so it seemed less).There were half a dozen muddy spots as noted in other reviews, but anyone wearing sensible hiking footwear should be fine.\u00a0\u00a0Overall, the hike wins for its proximity to Seattle (30 minutes, in theory), it's low overall altitude (re: snow melt), it's doable length for a first spring hike (7 miles RT, up for debate), and it's spectacular view of Mt. Rainier (on a clear day anyway). Minus points for the quarry, the encroaching suburbs, and the smallish trees.

No reflection on that guy, it was a mess and he was doing as best he could.It'll be really nice in a few weeks once the snow finally melts out, until then you might consider going early for a sunrise summit and then descending before the solar flux kicks in.Beautiful day for a summit, lots of sunshine with clouds lofting through...even had periodic sneaks of Rainier.Congrats to the couple that got engaged at the summit!", "date": "8 days ago"}],

I thought it might be helpful, since you'll be taking many different trails to complete this hike. The directions above are extremely helpful, but it was useful to me to list out all of the trails and have a visual representation in Google Maps.]I took the 554E bus over from Seattle to Issaquah (E Sunset Way & Rainier Blvd S stop), and walked over the High School Trailhead (~20 minutes). Got there around 9AM. There weren't any cars parked in the (very tiny) parking lot at that time.\u00a0First, I went to Poo Poo Point, taking the High School Trail, then Section Line Trail, then W Tiger Railroad Grade, then the Poo Poo Point Trail. Until I hit Poo Poo Point Trail, I didn't come across another living soul. It was incredibly quiet. The trails are pretty well-maintained, although W Tiger Railroad Grade definitely has more overgrowth than the other trails. I came across some fallen trees, but nothing that was an actual problem. Some parts of the trail were also quite muddy. Section Line Trail is pretty steep; poles are not a bad idea. Excellent views at Poo Poo Point as always.\u00a0After Poo Poo Point, I backtracked on Poo Poo Point Trail to get on the One View Trail, then Tiger Mountain Trail (at the junction, turn right), then Poo Top Trail to get to West Tiger No. 1. Poo Top Trail is\u00a0steep, much steeper than I expected it to be! Just an FYI. It took me a little while to get from Poo Poo Point to West Tiger No. 1. No issues navigating these trails, though. There are signs at the junctions so you know you're going the right way. Unfortunately, there aren't any good views from here. Fortunately, continuing along just a tiny bit on Bypass Trail to Hiker's Hut provides the most amazing views.\u00a0Past Hiker's Hut, I took the service road to West Tiger No. 2. It's downhill for a bit, and then an uphill that isn't anywhere near as steep as either Section Line or Poo Top Trail (it honestly felt a bit like a break). No issues with this part of the hike, but watch for the pieces of rubber/plastic on the service road that help with water drainage -- I almost tripped over one on the descent. No real views at West Tiger No. 2 either.\u00a0Finally, I went to West Tiger No. 3 per the Section Line Trail. This had a slight descent before ascending again, too, but it wasn't as extreme. Pretty good views at West Tiger No. 3, but the best views are definitely at Poo Poo Point and Hiker's Hut.\u00a0I descended per the Section Line Trail and High School Trail, and ended\u00a0back at the High School Trailhead. Section Line Trail was difficult to descend because of how steep it was, and I think I spent more time on the descent than I initially intended because I was a little nervous about slipping and falling. There are many loose rocks around, and it is an unmaintained trail per the signs surrounding parts of the trail. It was also hard on the knees, shins, and feet. If I were to do this hike again, I might try to take a less steep way down. I did see more people on my descent who were hiking up in the early afternoon.\u00a0Overall, this is quite a hike. I didn't encounter any snow or ice whatsoever on this clear day (still, I brought microspikes, just in case), but I'd keep checking the weather to see what the trail will end up being like. I wouldn't recommend taking Section Line Trail down if there's snow due to the steepness, even with microspikes.

I started hiking at around 8:45 and there were only a handful of other cars. The trail was a little too muddy in a first 1/4 of a mile, but there was a way to cross it or walk around it. Once the grade got steeper as I was walking up the Cable Line Trail it got drier, and it wasn't slippery at all. But I wish I have grabbed my walking poles. I eventually found tree stick and used those to help me walk up the hill, and I kept them the whole time until I got off the mountain. So if you have hiking poles, grab them, this is a trail to use them for!When I got to the Tiger #3 there were two other hikers, one of which eventually continued on right behind me. There is a very little view from Tiger #3, just a bench/rocks to sit down on and relax. After getting a quick sip of a water I continued onto Tiger #2. Once again, no view, just a large cell tower or whatever the purpos of this tower is. Don't turn around here, if you made it all the way here, continue another 3/4 of a mile to Tiger #1.

As soon as I was set to head out, this person made a comment behind my back that 'it is ridiculous how many people hike without real maps. Phones can lose signal. That is why there are so many search and rescues.'...I wish I have said something back to this person, but I refrained from it. But just FYI, I had spent time planning my route before I started my hike, the total round trip was only 6.5 miles, I know how to read maps, I backpacked for days in Olympics, and I always carry a backup battery for my phone. Tiger Moutain does not scare me. If you want to bad mouth, at least wait until I get out of sight.) Rant over...The rest of the trail was on good condition. Less steep on a way down. I returned down on Preston's Trail, Tiger Mountain Trail, Railroad Trail and unmaintained K-3 --> round trip of 6.5 miles and total moving time 2hrs 52min. There were 20-30 cars lining up the road as i returned back before noon.", "date": "Jan 1, 2018"}, {"comment": "Wanted to get in some mileage today but not travel too far so this stand-by it was!I parked just off exit 20 (didn't go to the upper lot so no discover pass needed) and set off around 9am. I took the high point trail to the parking lot. Now that so many other more impressive hikes are melted out, the parking lot was pretty empty. I only saw one person on the whole 4 mile stretch to Poo Poo Point. To start, bear right onto the bus trail and after crossing a bridge, you'll see a bench. This is the Nook Trail. Turn up here. It's one of my favorite sections of Tiger, peaceful, dense, quiet forest. It starts mild before picking up some gain. Eventually, you'll come to a split. Take a right toward the Section Line trail. You meander a short while on a flat ridge before coming to the SL. You head up to the left (down to the right is closed anyway). Here is one of the steepest sections of Tiger. The first climb prepares you for the last stretch, with a nice flat breather in between. I'm always relieved after getting up this lung buster.You'll then find yourself on Railroad Grade. Take a right. This whole section is fairly flat, with gentle ups and downs. However, it's very grown in right now, so much so it almost feels like bushwhacking! I ended up with lots of flower and leaf pieces stuck all over me. At times, it was extremely annoying, especially when you could really see what you were going to step on. There were a few blowdowns to walk over.Finally you pop out at the intersection from the high school trail to Poo Poo Point. Continue straight to Poo Poo. I took a little break here enjoying the sun, but not too long because it's probably only about halfway at this point. You go back to the intersection where you head up onto the One View Trail (fun fact: the one view is trees :P). You head up and then down and then up again and then down to the signed 15 Mile Gap. It's not far from here where you end up on the Tiger Mountain Trail. Take a right. This section is somewhat overgrown as well. You will come to an intersection with Hidden Forest Trail. \u00a0Head up to the left for another steep section of trail before flattening out and popping out onto a road (popular with bikers I think). Look straight ahead across the road for the continuation of the trail. It's a little hidden. This section is another steep one all the way up to Tiger 1 summit. You'll catch some flat breaks but will head back up. Finally towers come into view. Tag the summit sign and continue on the path descending down. Take a left toward Hiker's Hut. This area is one of my favorites. A perfect view of Rainier and over the sound to the Olympics. Almost no one is ever there so you'll have\u00a0a bench to yourself. Today there were dozens of dragonflies flitting around the sky. Another time, lots of ravens, The wildflowers are abundant right now.\u00a0Head down the road and past the gate, where you'll head back up to summit 2. Nothing to see here, so just find the trail in the northwest corner and head down into a little valley where the trail meets with TMT again. Stay straight and start heading up again and soon you'll be at Tiger 3. I saw people for the first time since Poo Poo Point here. From this point, you won't be alone. I headed down the Tiger 3 trail back to my car. Along the way, at some point, maybe to Poo Poo Point? I saw ripe salmonberries.\u00a0All told, this is about 13 miles and 3900' gain with all the ups and downs. Makes for an excellent trainer!", "date": "Jul 18, 2017"}, {"comment": "Started at High Pt.

The first couple miles were as steep as promised, but we managed it with no trouble. The burning thighs were forgotten as we approached lovely little Sheep Lake. We were surprised to find about 8 tents scattered around the meadows on a Wednesday night, but there were still many great sites available. We expected to find a box toilet in this busy area, but there wasn't one. The campers here seemed to embrace Leave No Trace and the area was pristine with the exception of the guy who let his beautiful horses graze right next to the lake. The biggest surprise was that there were very few bugs!Day 2--Dayhike up the PCT to Cispus BasinThis stretch of trail is absolutely breathtaking! We're so glad we had the extra day to enjoy this trail as a day hike. We had intended to hike all the way to Snowgrass Flats, but we spent too much time gawking at the views and wildflowers and rock formations through Cispus Pass and Basin. We were passed by several of the first through hikers to make it this far north, and they all declared this stretch of trail to be the best they'd seen yet. If we had it to do over, we would have spent a night at one of the 4 or 5 cliffside campsites at Cispus Basin. They were tucked away in the trees just past the Cispus River and they were surprisingly flat and roomy--but not good for sleep walkers!Day 3--PCT to Junction #101We were pleasantly surprised to find that the views continued here as well. In fact, stretches of this section of trail were even steeper than what we'd experienced at Cispus, and I had to concentrate on my feet to avoid the feeling of vertigo. At the very steepest part, we passed a team of volunteers (PCTA?) who were waltzing around like mountain goats. They told us they were camped at the second tarn on #101, but that there would be plenty of room for us. They were right, although we ended up camped in a dust bowl. This tarn isn't nearly as nice as Sheep Lake, but there are plenty of places to camp here and the berry picking was the best of the loop.Day 4--#101 to Walupt LakeWe expected this to be a boring hike out after our thrilling views from the days before. However, the forest here felt cozy and welcoming after the vast openness of the higher country. It was a trail typical of many in Western Washington, with lots of cedar and huge downed logs. It was a beautiful hike back to the car along the big lake and a perfect way to exit the wilderness.I would highly recommend this loop to those from out of state as it includes the best of all kinds of different trails. Many of the trip reports list this as a difficult loop, but anyone in decent shape should be able to handle it without trouble.\u00a0", "date": "Aug 23, 2017"}, {"comment": "This was a roughly 27 mile clockwise loop beginning and ending at the Walput Lake campground. If you have two vehicles, you may want to consider leaving one of the cars at Walput Lake and starting at the Berry Patch trailhead, as WTA recommends, but if you only have one car, start at Walput Lake and get the 7a portion of the loop out of the way on the first day.The 7a\u00a0trail,\u00a0which begins about a mile\u00a0down the road from Walput Lake across from the Coleman Weedpatch Trailhead, could be considered difficult/ impossible to navigate by some. Be sure you have a map and a screenshot or printout of the directions from the WTA descriptions. I also found that reading other trip reports on this section helped a lot! The trail up until the river is easy to follow and we opted to ford the river - shin/knee deep and a bit slippery, but not bad with trekking poles or a stick for balance. Look for the pink tags to continue the trail. From here things become more and more dicey. The trail will intersect with several old logging /fire roads and at times be very overgrown. When you reach the road with the firepit to your right, take a left and go down the road maybe a 10th of a mile and stay alert for the 7a marking sign and pink flags. At some point after this, we may have lost the actual trail for a while and just followed what was once a road until it seemed to dead end in a large clearing with a stone firepit, but we were able to continue on through pretty thick overgrowth on what seemed to be the trail and through a bit of mud until we reached another wider trail/road which eventually intersected with the well traveled gravel road leading to Snowgrass and Berry Patch trailheads. We opted to follow this to the Berry Patch trail head.\u00a0We intended to continue on to Jordan Basin this first day but after 5 or 6 miles of slow going on the 7a trail after a night of little sleep and the drive from Seattle, we decided to hike down to camp at Chambers Lake. The 7a trail continues west from the Berry Patch trailhead and across a small stream, which is a good place to fill up on water if you plan to continue up to Jordan Basin as there is no water until you reach the basin. Just past this stream, there is a rough trail leading downhill to the left which ends at the Chambers Lake campground, which is where we stayed.\u00a0Day 2: Rested and refreshed, we started on the Goat Ridge Trail (96a) which climbs moderately from the Berry Patch trailhead through the trees until after the second intersection with the Goat Ridge Lookout loop. From this point on the trail has little shade. there is one large campsite on a ledge about halfway between the Jordan Creek Trail (94) and Jordan Basin, but NO water. Continue on and up, enjoying wildflowers and views to Mt. St. Helens to Jordan Basin where you will find several sites to camp and water. *For a side trip hike up to Hawkeye Point for views of St. Helens, Rainier, and Adams. Once you cross over the ridge of Jordan Basin you will descend through stunning fields of wildflowers with views of Mt. Adams to the South and the Goat Rocks to the East. There are several sites just before the final descent to Goat Lake as well as a few just off to the South of Goat Lake. Goat Lake\u00a0(still has some ice!) made for a great lunch spot and we refilled water here, which you'll want to do as the trail continues with no shade. We continued on down the Lily Basin Trail (86) until we reached Snowgrass Flats and the\u00a0intersection with trail 96 (plenty of campsites just before this point). We took 96 up to the PCT where we passed several wonderful sites with stunning views of Mt. Adams and Mt. St. Helens! At the junction with the PCT, we pressed on South to Cispus Basin. There are a handful of sites before entering the basin, but they were mostly occupied by a work party (Thank You, volunteers!). We decided to camp at the head of the basin where there is a large site for several groups just above the trail as well as a few smaller sites a bit further off the trail and down the basin. Our site at\u00a0Cispus Basin\u00a0offered in your face views of the Goat Rocks and a perfectly framed view of St. Helens. There was a large herd of goats higher up in the basin and evidence of them around the campsite.PSA about poop: If you camp in Cispus Basin, know that it is very exposed and there are multiple streams flowing throughout the area. Please plan ahead to find a suitable area for your cathole that is at least 200 ft (~70 steps) from one of the many creeks! \u00a0Day 3:\u00a0Up and out of the Basin and over Cispus Pass to more incredible views of the Goat Rocks and Gilbert Peak. On this side of the pass, we found a wonderful sunny rock to eat breakfast on and experience the eclipse (~96%)! As the trail exits the Yakima Reservation, you will pass through areas of both forest and meadow on the way to Sheep Lake where there are plenty of camp sites. Sheep Lake is a small and tranquil lake and we had read that it is home to the struggling northwestern salamanders, so for this reason we resisted the temptation to soak our sunscreen and bug spray coated bodies in the lake. We did fill up our water here as we were not certain of the next opportunity to do so. From the lake, we continued along the very dusty\u00a0Nannie Ridge Trail (98)\u00a0back to our car at the Walput Lake Campground where we ditched our packs and promptly went for a\u00a0very refreshing swim in Walput Lake!All in all, a 10 out of 10 trail!

It looked like most people were hiking counterclockwise from Walput Lake (I was the opposite). Chose this hike to escape the smoky air from the BC fires, which filled the Mt. Adams valley on Day 1 but ended up being a good choice as things cleared up nicely by Day 3. On a scale of 1=\"theme park\" and 10=\"feels like I am the last human on earth\" I would give Goat Rocks wilderness a 6.5, right ahead of the Rainier NW loop and behind the North Cascades. Itinerary:Day 1 Snowgrass- Cispus BasinGot on the trail at 11:30am, it was Friday and a very full parking lot. Took about 2 hours to get to the junction with Bypass #97 (which I took), and another 2 hours to get to my campsite at Cispus Basin. Only one blowdown on the Bypass, but there was a well-trodden path around it. Plenty of water along the way but the day was hot and the Cispus Basin part of the train is very exposed. Incredible wildflowers. Such a pretty campsite - the ones in the trees were all taken but I found one towards the end of the Basin. Thanks all for keeping these sites clean, they looked great. Day 2 Day hike Cispus Basin - PCT \" The Knife\" - Old Snowy - Cispus BasinWaited until the thunder/lightning storm passed and got going at 8:30am. Almost stepped on a grouse which startled me and I shrieked so loud I think I woke up the whole valley! Was very unprepared for this hike after the shale switchbacks at Packwood - I left the poles at my tent and only decided to go as far as I did based on a rec from a fellow hiker. Took the horse trail to the knife but the snowfields were too ifffy and a bit scary to cross. Definitely take the upper hikers trail over the hill, it's not worth saving a few hundred meters distance. Views of all 3 mountains (Adams, Rainier, St. Helens) were incredible from the knife. Side note: some obnoxious person brought a drone up that was buzzing around the Snowgrass-Alpine PCT junction, so we all have it the finger. Can we please make these things illegal on trail? Day 3 Day hike Cispus Basin - Nannie Ridge - Cispus Basin. It rained all night and morning, so decided to stay put and continue with the day hikes. The Yakima reservation on the other side of the Pass was incredible. So stunningly different from the Basin on the other side. Gentle hike in the wind and mist through meadows and woods, passed a WTA crew along the way. There is no sign up to Nannie Peak, just a path that cuts up to the right just before the trail started going sharply downhill. The only way I knew it was here was from a map. Only water the whole way was at Sheep Lake - no other streams, just a very dodgy-looking pond. Day 4 Cispus Basin - SnowgrassUneventful, but very pretty!

Lots of camping in a beautiful area but we continued on to try to grab a spot at Cispus Basin. We didn't get there early enough, even on a week day, to snag a spot so we pushed on to Sheep Lake. Also a beautiful setting and lots of camping. We stayed packed up and head a little down the way to a tiny lake that we had all to ourselves. We day hiked to Nannie Peak, only about a mile to the junction, and napped and swam for the rest of the HOT afternoon. We woke up early the next day, hiking 3 1/2 miles to Walupt Lake and had breakfast and coffee. We walked down the road to the 7A trailhead. The 7A trail that heads back to the Snowgrass Flats trailhead is decently trotted and we didn't have any issues following the trail.

The turnoff onto Forest Road 2160, meanwhile, is a pleasant surprise. The road is narrow but mostly smooth, thanks to the asphalt/chip-sealed surface. Whew.As for the trail itself, it\u2019s in great shape, although dusty, given the lack of rain this summer.After a mile and a half of pretty steep climbing, the rest of the trial is gently rolling, with only a few short, steep climbs/descents, as you make your way to Sheep Lake. Still plenty of huckleberries and blueberries to be had. A few sections of the trail were fragrant with the scent of ripening berries.At about the halfway point, there is a short side trail that apparently takes you to Nannie Peak. We didn\u2019t bother, since a smoky haze from the wildfires kept Mt. Adams relatively obscured in the distance. The extra 300 feet of climbing didn\u2019t seem worth it.The views of the nearby scenery, though, particularly Goat Rocks, were impressive. The lake is tranquil and cool. Lots of bugs with no respect for personal space, but nobody got bit. We dipped our aching feet in the lake and were the better for it. On our way back, my son took advantage of the golden hour and captured a great photo of a picturesque little tarn next to the trail. We also shot video, as usual (see below).", "date": "Aug 27, 2017"}, {"comment": "It's been a while since I've visited the Goat Rocks Wilderness, so what better way to go back than for my first ever BCRT and Hike-a-Thon hike!This trail would easily\u00a0make a great day hike, but is definitely worth an overnight if you have the time! Our small group of volunteers camped a few miles in at a PCTA basecamp surrounded by a beautiful field of lupine, and took day hikes from there up to Sheep Lake and Nannie Peak.Despite the abundance of trail crews working on Nannie Ridge, the trail is in pretty excellent shape for hikers. Most of the work being done is focused on increasing safety for horses and other pack animals. If you head out between now and mid-September, except to see some WCC and PCTA crews out making even more improvements!The first two miles of the trail are a pretty steady uphill, but mostly shaded, until you get to the ridge where the trail flattens out and becomes much more exposed. Unfortunately, we picked the smokiest weekend ever to venture up Nannie Ridge, so the views along the way were pretty much non-existent. On the bright side, there were plenty of scenic meadows, lakes, and wildflowers to keep the trail interesting. The huckleberries are just starting to ripen in the sunny spots of the ridge. I picked a handful or two of questionably ripe berries out of desperation, but I would give it a week or two before you can expect a really bountiful harvest.The lake itself is one of the best swimming lakes around (though I'm totally bias after working in the hot sun and dust for 8 hours before jumping in).

Arriving around 9:30, the parking lot was full and cars were parked along the side of the road around the lot. Better to get there much earlier than we did, apparently.I don't recall ever using the word \"magical\" to describe a particular trail, but this one fits that description. What I find most attractive about the Lost Creek Ridge trail from the parking area to Bingley Gap is the depth of the forest. With its high canopy and tall conifers, the forest interior feels as vaulted as a cathedral, but still enclosed. It's lush and intimate, a storybook forest with ferns and moss-covered rocks. Soft ground with minimal roots and rocks makes the push toward Bingley easy on the feet, despite the gain.The trail beyond the forest is overgrown and washed out in a few places requiring more attention on foot placement. Slipping off the trail is possible, because the path is no longer level in isolated spots, so be careful.My group and I reached Round Lake overlook without issues then proceeded on various boot (mountain goat?) paths to Breccia Peak. The route-finding took longer than I expected and, frankly, we found no easy way to reach the peak. But once there, we agreed the views were spectacular and the peak itself was covered in wildflowers. Imagine viewing Glacier Peak, Pugh, Sloan, Baker, and dozens of other peaks from a high-elevation garden. (We looked all around for the summit log mentioned in a previous trip report, but couldn't find it.)\u00a0On the return we decided to go back a different route: through the Sunup Lake camp area and back down to the main trail. This way is a longer distance than the Breccia approach over the Round Lake ridge area, but ultimately faster because little route finding is required once you reach Sunup.", "date": "Jul 29, 2017"}, {"comment": "I did not hike this trail today so I don\u2019t know what the conditions are like on the trail. This trail report is here to let you know how bad the road damage is. I went to scout out the damage and\u00a0leave some info here for anyone who is looking for some more concreate information.Forest road 49 or Sloan Creek/North Fork Sauk road is passable but is indeed damaged about .6 miles in from mountain loop highway. However, you will need a high ground clearance vehicle to make it. The road is washed out on the right-hand side, it\u2019s about a 3-foot crater however it\u2019s not so serious that I feel like driving over the road that\u2019s still intact will cause someone to fall in. With that said there is one other problem. On the left-hand side of the road where the roads still intact there\u2019s a huge ditch on the left that\u2019s about 2 feet below the surface of the main road. So basically, your right tire is going to be way higher than your left one which will be way down in the ditch. This is why I recommend high clearance vehicle so you don\u2019t bottom out.

It starts out nice and gentle, then climbs steeply up to the ridge.  By the time I got to the turn off to Round Lake there was snow on the trail.  The first snow of the year.

There was never more than two or three inches on the trail, but because the trail is a bit overgrown I was getting pretty wet from all the bushes and shrubs I was running in to.  All the blueberries kept slowing me down too. I'm surprised there are still berries.  There were a lot of them once I got up high enough.  On the way back I stopped at the ridge looking down to Round Lake.  The views were pretty amazing today.  I love the look of clouds and fog moving in and out of the mountains.

He said he made it all the way to the falls, but that he had to make his own trail, had difficulty finding the right one. This was my first time snowshoeing and it was not easy. I turned around because just after trying to pass a clearing where the trail was just big enough for one of my shoes. I did not feel comfortable to continue. Other than that there is a lot of snow falling from warming temperatures. Be sure not to rest under trees, a couple of snow falls landed on me.

That's a given, being February on Mt Rainier. Snow itself is easy though, being well packed. Poles and micro-spikes were sufficient.\u00a0That said, I did not make it very far. An avalanche hit the trail about 1/3 of a mile after the falls. It'll be obvious for the next few days where it happened, it looks like a chute further up the hill leads straight into the river. The problem with this is that it's still fairly uneven snow, and if you slip it's unlikely you'll be able to catch yourself before tumbling into the river.\u00a0It's not a very wide chute though. A person with more than just trekking poles and spikes, and a bit more experience, would probably find the thing trivial. I elected to turn around and do a hike to reflection lake instead.\u00a0If you want a very short hike however (half mile, round trip), just stopping at the first set of waterfalls could be worthwhile.\u00a0", "date": "Feb 7, 2018"}, {"comment": "There's a lot of snow on the trail to Comet Falls right now. We made it about .3 miles from the trailhead before we really encountered snow on the trail. Overall we made it about 1.5 miles.

We were able to make it a ways with just hiking boots and poles, but the trail was still sketchy at times and we turned around at 1.5 miles due to lack of gear.

Our group made it up to Comet Falls and back down with only minor slips and spills, but I would highly recommend trail spikes and poles to safely make it to the falls.\u00a0 A few good looks of pikas along the trail and two singing American dippers flying up the river valley were the fan favorites in regards to wildlife.\u00a0 Fall colors are out but quickly being covered by snow.", "date": "Oct 15, 2017"}],

Followed the unmaintained trail for quite a ways, drinking in the views of Mt. Adams, Mount St. Helens, and the Tatoosh range. Grateful for the relative clarity of the skies and air today! Always dumbfounded by the many faces of Tahoma, red and rocky cliff faces on the SW face! \u00a0\u00a0Mildred Point: \u00a0Character building. The trail is rutted, almost hip deep at points. The trail is dusty, positively Tatooine. The elevation gain at the last stretch of the trail is no joke, and trekking poles are definitely welcome for the descent. I believe dust glissading became my new specialty. However, contemplating the barren, almost martian terrain of the Kautz Glacier is a reward well worth the dust.What you should bring: \u00a0At least 2L water per person, trekking poles, spirit of adventureWhat you will gain: Quantum Quads, a natural bronze (courtesy of the dust), SO MANY VIEWS, and a huge smile on your face for the rest of the day!", "date": "Sep 11, 2017"}, {"comment": "Left trailhead around 11:30am on Sunday.

We got all of that and more. We arrived at the trailhead around 10 a.m., accidentally driving past the small parking lot on the left. It was full, but there was another small parking area about 1/4 mile beyond that we used and hiked down from.We didn't exactly get an early start and it was Labor Day weekend, so we were pleasantly surprised that the trail wasn't crowded. The hikers we did see were all ages. Dogs are not allowed here, even on leash, but we did pass one, unfortunately. This hike comes with a soundtrack! We loved the sound of water along much of the trail, even when we couldn't see it. Comet Falls make a dramatic appearance through the trees even before you reach them. Don't miss the opportunity to walk over and let the spray refresh you on a hot day.\u00a0The trail was dry, dusty and rooty, but well maintained. We were impressed by WTA volunteers' work, especially the creation of a \"staircase\" on a particularly steep section. Shoes with good tread are important--there are steep, gritty areas where we and others nearly lost footing. The big tube of sunscreen came out several times, as\u00a0there are plenty of spots along the way up through cool old-growth to step out from the trees and enjoy valley and mountain views before reaching the end of the maintained trail, which is much more exposed, running through meadows with subalpine fir. Even though it was hot, dry and late summer, there are\u00a0still wildflowers to enjoy. We each got an invisible nip or two from flies but nothing to require bug\u00a0juice\u00a0that could interfere with the beautiful-smelling forest. We caught glimpses of woodpeckers near the turn-around point (just past the end of the maintained trail) and a squeaking\u00a0pika.There's a foot bridge that crosses Van\u00a0Trump\u00a0Creek, and easy access to the rushing water in which we dunked our hot, sweaty heads by lying on the warm, smooth rocks on the way back.\u00a0One of the best surprises, besides the clear views of St Helens, Mt Adams and Mt Rainier of course, was ripe huckleberries along the trail higher up. My hiking companion had never had huckleberries that weren't store-bought and was amazed at how delicious they taste in the wild.\u00a0Any soreness after this hike is well worth the experience. Hiking time, including breaks and lunch, was nearly 5 hours. On the drive home, we stopped at Elbe Junction, for a well deserved affogato and delicious, home made\u00a0ice cream cone.\u00a0Huckleberry, of course!", "date": "Sep 3, 2017"}],

I would totally recommend going even if it is an extra ~10 miles. The views are incredible! We started our trip at 10:30 a.m. and there were only 4 cars parked by the gate. You can either walk along the main road for about 5 miles or you can take a shortcut via Mowich lake trail that saves you about a mile in total. The trailhead to the lookout starts at lake Mowich and the first half a mile takes you along its beautiful turquoise green waters. You continue your trip in the woods for about\u00a02 miles at a moderate incline until you get to the bottom of lake Eunice. From there it is only a mile up to the fire lookout with elevation of at least 600 feet. The snow level was low, we didn't even need micro spikes that day!

From here it is mostly uphill, but the grade isn't too bad.\u00a0 Make your way up the moderate graded hill until you reach Eunice Lake... from here catch your first views of the summit and the lookout tower (yes, they are different).Continue West along the lake's edge and ascend the ridgeline Northwest of Eunice Lake.\u00a0 Ascend and follow the ridgeline East until you reach the lookout tower. Continue on to the true summit if you wish, although the views from the lookout are comparable.To continue onto the true summit, proceed East up and down along the ridgeline until you reach the obvious high point.\u00a0 The route is fairly straightforward and is suitable for all levels of scramblers (nothing above a class II).", "date": "Oct 5, 2017"}],

I then started up the trail and within 100 feet... had no idea where the trail went. I made the mistake of assuming the trail would be fairly easy to follow even in the snow and did not download any trail maps beforehand. Boy was I wrong. Such a rookie mistake. Being that I had never done the hike before and was by myself, I decided to call it a day and head back.Disappointing, but it's just an excuse to come back at another time.

Started off with the microspikes, needed those for the first few miles. Then snowshoes were required as the slushy snow gets deeper. The ice covered snow on the 45 degree slopes made it tricky going with snowshoes, while not using them just made my legs sink in to my waist.The trail was tricky going, pretty hard, but super fun with amazing views, even in the rain. I'm glad I didn't take dogs, it would've been far too hard for them.\u00a0Might be important to note that there isn't a bridge across the stream at Twin lake as you make the left turn at the sign, you will have to jump across, which can be tricky in the snow.

It was about as perfect a fall day as it could be, and it felt like everyone had the same idea. Great day to be in the mountains!\r Started up the main trail and soon branched off on the Esmeralda trail. After that, I would only see 7 people the rest of the day. It\u2019s definitely the little sister trail to Lake Ingalls in popularity, but it\u2019s got plenty to offer. The larches, lake, ridges & views made for a super worthy hike.\r Early in the day, the lower shady sections of trail had intermittent compact snow and ice, but once breaking out into the south facing sunny slopes higher up, it was mainly bare. The last half mile to the top had several inches of random boot-tracked snow, and it felt more like cross-country than established trail.\r It was very windy at the top of Esmeralda Basin. And, the whole area around (99% frozen) Lake Ann was shadowed in the morning. Combined with the winds, it was quite the change of temps from the sunny south side. Not to mention, the descent to the lake is semi-steep and snow covered up to 6-8\u201d. I threw on all my layers and had the whole place to myself. The combination of golden larches around a boulder-strewn frozen lake, in a relative moonscape terrain was surreal.\r From Lake Ann I continued north, breaking trail in about 4-6\u201d of untouched heavy snow along the County Line (west) trail. It was pretty easy-going along a mellow mostly flat grade, and in about 45 minutes I was at Van Epps pass. I had no itinerary past this point, but still had time to continue extending. \r Van Epps Pt 6728 loomed to the west. It was a fun looking scramble so off I went. It had a mostly snow-free southern facing approach and soon I was on top enjoying awesome 360 views. To the immediate north & below me were the massively scarred remains of the Jack Creek fire. Lots of visible swathes of destruction, but I guess it\u2019s really just nature\u2019s way of giving herself a facelift.

If you're going to Lake Ingalls, there is a turn off on the right hand side very soon after the shared trail starts (and a sign that says Esmeralda Basin on which someone wrote \"Lk Ingalls --->\" in pencil).The trail, bathroom, parking lot and trail signage are in great shape. Lovely trail, streams here and there on the way up, long and wide switchbacks, beautiful fall foliage all the way up to the top...and then it's like you're on Mars!

The pit toilet here has a beautiful view (please use it and don't pee willy-nilly, and the goats are attracted to the salt in urine).Day two started out with one more mile up and over to gorgeous, clear Lake Ingalls where we did a bit of swimming and fly fishing (4 lake trout!), and then we started the long, slow decent into the Ingalls Creek Basin. If you turn right just after the lake outlet on the far side and head downhill, you will eventually join up with Ingalls Way, which follows Ingalls Creek all the way to the trailhead off Highway 97.Previously this hardly-traveled route from the lake to Cascade\u00a0Creek required much bushwhacking and fallen-tree scrambling, but thanks to the WTA's recent work, we only had to climb over 3 trees and the trail was easy to follow though still somewhat overgrown (waist-high bushes). The wildflowers were pretty and we found ripe blueberries in many places. We also ran into a 6-horse pack train coming up Hardscrabble Creek Trail delivering a massive amount of bushcraft tools for a WTA work party--so cool!We spent the second night near Falls Creek on a sandy beach. Ingalls Creek has a ton of beautiful campsites up and down its 15-mile length -- some require walking across the river or onto islands in the middle of it.

I've only done the trail once before and it was during summer and really dry, I actually prefer it this way.There was one downed tree that happened to fall across the trail right at a turn, making it look like a closed off boot path. After continuing up the drainage for a bit and running into a wall of brush I figured out what happened and ended up moving the downed tree to instead block the non-trail drainage.There is a decent amount of snow going up to Rampart Lakes and not a lot of boot prints. I ran into a handful of people and the way back already had a noticeably better boot path through the snow. There weren't footprints around the Rampart loop, so I blazed through 8\" of snow.

It was easy enough to travel on but you can see tracks from someone glissading (seems like a terrible idea- maybe they fell? There's just a bunch of rocks and trees to crash in to) and it gets steep. Boot track is easy to follow but it's also along a path that's over covered boulders. While it was cold enough while we were there to not punch through, we could clearly see where folks had. We kept going a little ways but with clouds socking everything in it was hard to see if the snow got worse or better. We had microspikes and were ready for snow but chose to turn around. On our way back it started to rain heavily- I really hope everyone we saw in jeans and sneakers turned around at the snow. Why are there so many people wearing cotton on this trail?If you go: be prepared for snow travel and hidden boulders beneath steep snow, well before the trail junction to Bandara/Mason Lake. Not sure an ice axe would have done that much- it's plunge stepping in to a boulder and taking it hard on the shin or ankle that concerned me more than anything else.Road was pretty potholed.

Trail head was easy to find after parking on side of road (small parking lot was full). Make sure you take the right hand road at the fork. You're still in a neighborhood - which is actually kind of cool! - and the start of the trail is just a few hundred feet away. Starts out with a switchback up a short hill, but the way soon eases and remains mostly easy going, with the occasional moderate hill. We wandered for several hours, going down into draws, usually with a little stream, thankfully for the dog. I know these trails have names, and I'm going to learn them before I go again, but there must be dozens of routes. It was a little hard choosing! At about 2 miles we had to make a decision: uphill, downhill, or straight. We asked some cyclists and are so glad we took their advice as we saw some really amazing rock formations and views. This trail took us way up above a little valley and to a peak with an incredible 360\u00b0 view. Heading down now we contemplated having lunch at a random, but artfully placed bench, but it was a bit on the windy side. We instead headed down a windy path to the valley bottom and sat on a rock surrounded by cool sandstone columns. A brook babbled nearby whilst we munched on a delicious sandwich and the most amazing cookie from Weeds in Cashmere. Climbed up out of the draw and headed back on a path right below the one we had travelled in on. \r5.2 easy miles. Saw lots of hikers, a number of dogs, many cyclists whizzing down the windy track, some lovely flowers - penstemon, a couple of balsamroot (two more weeks and they'll be in full bloom) and some others I couldn't identify, and lots of cool rock formations.

Apparently this was the first day the trail was open too.  Perhaps because of that, the gravel road was in quite good condition, though there was a decent amount of traffic so careful driving was still required.  The parking lot at the top was pretty full but had some room, and the outhouse was in fine condition.\r We wandered around the trails for maybe 6 miles total, and were able to do most of it as a loop.  The trails were rutted in a few places, and occasionally muddy or dusty, but generally were easy to navigate. Mountain bikers made up a majority of the crowd, but they were not too numerous and there were not problems letting them around.  \r While it doesn't go anywhere in particular, the trail offers sweeping views of Wenatchee, the surrounding orchards, the Columbia, and the still-snowy mountains to the west.  Green grass, early flowers, sunshine and mid-60s temperatures were a welcome taste of spring.  The only catch was that this hike was very windy in exposed spots. So it could feel positively hot in the calm areas, and then quite cold as soon as the wind picked up again. \r This probably gets very hot and dusty in the summer, but hit the spot for a spring hike.", "date": "Apr 1, 2017"}, {"comment": "not too difficult, views of town", "date": "Jun 7, 2016"}],

We were only able to make it as far as the junction/sign post for Mason Lake/Bandera Mtn due to too much snow and increased uncertainty about how to safely continue with limited gear. We were prepared for snow with gators and warm clothing, but no spikes or mountaineering gear beyond hiking poles.Full Scoop:\u00a0The trail up to the first small set of switch backs within the Alpine Lakes wilderness was wide, easy, and clear of snow. The section of trail that climbs in elevation while also heading north began to have increased portions of trail covered in snow, but it was all easily passible, packed down, and simple to navigate with\u00a0regular\u00a0boots. At some point,\u00a0as more and more snow was in our path, we stopped to eat and put on gators. Then continued as the\u00a0trail became a march across relatively soft and wet packed snow. At the edge of a talus field of exposed boulders, the snow became thinner and\u00a0we began to\u00a0fall through the layer of snow, risking harm to legs/limbs. After checking GPS we recognized we had reached the end of the main climb. It was time to move east across\u00a0what must be a meadow or talus field, though everything was covered in snow. At this point we could see some foot prints of\u00a0people who had come before us. Following their path and\u00a0kicking steps into the snow, we made it across the snow covered talus field (or meadow)\u00a0until finding the junction sign for Mason Lake/Bandera Mountain. At this point, it was 2:30p, the foot steps we were following had turned around, and we could feel temps dropping a bit as it began to snow. The last 200 ft across the snow field had been a little bit of an adventure, slightly exposed to the hillside. We didn't want to have to cross\u00a0the exposed hillside again if the snow became harder and more ice-like. We called it a day and began retracing our steps as we headed back down to the parking lot.", "date": "2 days ago"}, {"comment": "The road is potholed but driveable. My Hyundai Elantra and I made it by slowing down, driving around the biggest holes, and slowing down some more.Arrived in the parking lot on a Tuesday at about 1:00. There was no more than a scattering of other cars there.Intermittent soft snow on the trail starting about halfway up posed no problems. I did not need my micro-spikes - although, if it had been early in the day, and the snow had been hard and slick, it's possible that I'd have worn them. I put on gaiters shortly before the rock field under the ridgeline, because postholing had become an issue.\u00a0At the rockfield, the trail becomes entirely hypothetical. I chose to go straight up to the ridge, enjoying the surprising refreshment of repeated crotch-deep postholing. I chose not to continue to Mason Lake from the ridgetop, since I didn't have snowshoes. On the way back down, I followed a set of snowshoe tracks that traversed a snowfield in one long switchback; postholing happened there, too, but it wasn't so frequent.I was glad to have my poles (with snow baskets) and my gaiters. If I'd had snowshoes, I'd have worn them.

Half way through the hike the trail turned into snow, it was compact but you were standing about 5 inches higher than the trail itself, with loose fluffy snow to your sides.

We made a spontaneous trip out to the peninsula, spending the morning at the Olympic Hot Springs and then heading to Ozette, reaching the trailhead around 3pm.We took the Cape Alava trail out to Cape Alava, passing through beautiful high brush and several gorgeous meadows. From there, we walked down the coast to Sand Point. Cape Alava was much different than we expected. We spent half our time trying to avoid the massive swarms of flies on the gravel-ish sand close to the shore, and the other half jumping from rock to rock closer to the water, avoiding crabs with each step.The difference between Cape Alava and Sand Point is like night and day. Once we walked around the corner separating the two, the beach was pristine - not a single rock or piece of seaweed in sight, hard-packed sand for as far as the eye could see, waves crashing gracefully on the shore. We took off our shoes and socks and waded in - cold, but not unbearably so!We then proceeded to hike out on the Sand Point trail, finally hitting the ranger station again at 7:15pm. The two boardwalked trails took us 1 hour each, and the beach portion 2 hours. Being flat, this is a great hike for families, and an excellent overnight destination!

Total combined mileage is a shade over 7 with gross vertical over 600 with all the ups and downs. \r No issues with any of the trails and all surface streets can be safely walked.  Camp Long suffered quite a bit of blowdown this winter though it is nearly all bucked up and out of the way.  The forest there is interesting - mostly open deciduous second generation growth including maple, red alder, chestnut and madrone. There has been a bunch of volunteer work done to pull invasives - looks nice.  The Schurman climbing rock is still open to everybody - good practice for an alpine scramble later in the season!\r The Seattle Chinese Garden and appurtenant traditional arboretum are beautiful  - worth a trip by itself.  Note that the interior courtyard is closed on Mondays and has other regularly scheduled events.   Don't miss the rock garden in the northwest corner of the arboretum.  Lastly, the walk over includes some super nice views of downtown from the Rotary Viewpoint along 35th Ave.  \r https://www.seattle.gov/parks/reserve/event-space-rentals/camp-long\rhttp://seattlechinesegarden.org/\rhttp://www.southseattle.edu/arboretum/", "date": "Apr 16, 2017"}, {"comment": "The Seattle Chinese Garden at South Seattle Community College was a great find with criss-crossing trails through a beautiful garden setting.

The road to the trailhead was not in particularly good shape. There were numerous potholes, sometimes\u00a0scattered on the entire width of the\u00a0road and impossible to avoid. This was especially bad just past the junction with the Ira Springs trail road. We managed to do it in a 2 door sedan, as did one other person at the trailhead, and someone else drove a minivan up there. We did bottom out twice because I was not as careful as I should have been. It's passable by any car, but certainly pushing the limits of what a low clearance vehicle can do.The road was snow free all the way to the parking lot. There was a bit of slushy snow just before the parking lot, but it was easily passable.The first part of the trail was muddy or dry ground. Eventually, it became compacted snow and some ice. No traction aides were needed if you walked carefully, although they did help a little. People were headed up there in sneakers, and they were fine.The trail got considerably snowier as we approached the lake. It was all packed down so no postholing.The bridge across the creek to head to Ollalie had a ridge of snow on top of it with mostly melted out snow on the sides. You could carefully straddle the ridge and walk across.\u00a0I would never cross it without microspikes, as there would be a decent chance you could tumble into the frigid creek. That 10 feet was the only place microspikes were necessary.Once across the creek, there were a few other easy water crossings, either on a bridge or over packed snow. At the edge of the lake, the trail to Ollalie became a maze of footprints. Pretty much all of them converged to the same place, but the easiest way to navigate would to be to walk left (when facing away from lake) following the edge of the lake around 20 feet and then follow up the track up. You will run into the sign for the toilet, and follow the tracks up.The snow was pretty compacted to Ollalie Lake, but then it became quite a bit deeper with some postholing of 1-2 feet especially when the snow warmed up later in the day. We brought snowshoes, and they would have helped as we got really near Ollalie, but in retrospect, I would have left them in the car. They weren't necessary by any means if you didn't mind postholing a bit, and you had to carry them quite far for only a few hundred feet of use. However, if you proceed past Olallie, I suspect they may be far more helpful.When we turned around (1:30 pm), the snow had softened quite a bit and we were postholing a lot more as we descended to Talapus. It was OK because we could just plunge step down. At the sketchy bridge crossing, the creek was raging. A fall into it could be life threatening.We wore the spikes on the way down, and it allowed us to walk confidently down the snow and ice quickly. Still not necessary.", "date": "Apr 15, 2018"}, {"comment": "We parked about 0.5 miles before the trailhead, because of snow on the road.\u00a0 It should probably melt out soon.\u00a0 The start of the hike has no snow, but it shows up as you gain elevation.\u00a0 You could definitely walk with boots but nothing else special to Talapus Lake, the trail is packed down.\u00a0 There was about 4 feet of snow at Talapus.\u00a0 We definitely needed our snowshoes to go up the hillside to Olallie... it was ideal snowshoe conditions and probably will be for a while longer.\u00a0 Olallie had 8+ feet of snow it seemed.\u00a0 Really nice hike.FYI: some group decided to throw a bunch of lunch trash around on the snow at Talapus lake.\u00a0 Maybe they know something I don't, but it was a bunch of orange peels that will probably be there on the snow for everyone to see until June.\u00a0 Not cool.\u00a0 And they distributed bread for the (already very aggressive... they were landing on my boots during lunch!) birds, including spearing tree branches with chunks of bread like it was the Dark Ages.", "date": "Mar 31, 2018"}, {"comment": "By the time we thought to turn around it was too late...We were in an all wheel drive car, sandwiched between two other all wheel drive cars, stuck in a sinking wet ditch.\u00a0Thanks to some Alaska training, perhaps the only good thing to come out of nine months of snow a year, it only took half an hour of digging and branch pulling and swearing and we were back on the highway ready to choose a dry sunny hike somewhere else.We suggest you do the same!\u00a0", "date": "Mar 10, 2018"}, {"comment": "There hadn't been any trip reports before my adventure on Saturday in about 3 weeks and maybe for good reason. Most AWD/4WD cars could make it to the split for Talapus Lake. If you don't have snow driving experience, I wouldn't even recommend that. We maybe made it another mile beyond that but the ruts were just getting too deep and mushy for even a high clearance vehicle. We were clearly the vehicle that'd made it farthest in recent weeks and we still only made it halfway before abandoning and hiking up the road. There's over 2' of snow in the parking area.The hike itself (after almost an hour up the road) was nice, somewhat packed, and reasonable enough to follow for maybe the first 3/4. About the point of the log bridge crossing, the trail became all but impossible to follow. Fortunately, we had GPS and/or just followed the stream the last few hundred yards to Talapus - didn't attempt Olallie. Snowshoes were almost definitely needed.As a side note - I imagine if you're reading this, you have some skills of planning but we actually happened to be following a couple (couldn't tell how fresh the post hole tracks were until they passed us on their return down) in solely tennis shoes & sweats. No traction. No essentials. Judging by their tracks, they turned around after being waist deep so close to the lake but didn't make it. Use some common sense. Same goes for the disaster of cars we encountered on our drive out of people attempting to drive up a snow packed road and have no business doing so and getting stuck turning around.", "date": "Mar 10, 2018"}],

At 4.25 miles one way, Big Tree is a great destination/turn around spot for a day hike.\u00a0Or you can head up the steep but short hill (just a few switchbacks) onto the old road/rail grade. The forest back here is stunning with old logging stumps, ferns \u00a0and second growth hemlock, cedars, and douglas firs thick with moss on every surface. You will know when you are on the old rail bed when you see the trail begin to look like moss covered corduroy. It feels like stepping back in time. Keep your eyes peeled for old logging artifacts. We found old pots, iron trestle fittings, and choker cables along the trail corridor.The waterfall at mile 5, or the creek near mile 6 are both great turn around spots if you hike the rail corridor.

As is previously mentioned in other trip reports and exceedingly well documented here: http://www.nwhikers.net/forums/viewtopic.php?p=1122563. There is a very large landslide area 1.1 miles from the trailhead. The area is described as \u201cactive\u201d and there are scary signs marking the trail as closed. The actual closed area demarcated by the signs is only the area where the slide occurred. Additionally, the can be navigated by skirting the zone to the south which is uphill through soggy, brushy, loose terrain. Having gone through this area I wouldn\u2019t necessarily recommend it as I did see separation cracks in the landscape and the hillside is relatively steep and thus prone to slide. I tried my best to move through this terrain as fast as possible.After this portion the trail the very easy going with a general upward trend, small patches of snow here and there and areas where the trail is flooded. There are some significant blow downs along the way, but everything is easily navigated. Burnboot creek right as you leave the Middle Fork Trail and enter the Goldmyer Hot Springs property takes a little extra work as you have to hop along a log jam and wade through a fast-moving section of the creek. As the temps warm up and snow melts, this will only get worse.Goldmyer is wonderful and while I was there I got to meet and chat with the Caretakers and a Board Member for the property. Fantastic people! Some quick notes about the Hot Springs if you wish to go, visit their website and give them a call for a reservation. They\u2019ll send you a waiver form which you\u2019ll bring with you and give to the Caretakers as this is your ticket to soak in the tubs. Additionally, there is a pretty bad mouse problem so careful with snacks! The pools are well taken care of and consist of three pools each with varying temperatures. I was lucky enough to be the first visitor after the pools had been cleaned and to have no one else with me in the pools! Amazing! I soaked for an hour and then strapped on the Altras and started running again.I decided to run the road back to the parking lot because I didn\u2019t want to deal with the slide area again. And while I\u2019m usually not a fan of running on roads, its still very beautiful and there weren\u2019t too many people.Back at the car after 5 hours of running, some hot springs soaking and great conversation.

We got to where he turned around and continued breaking trail through nearly waist deep snow through a few more switchbacks - regretting our snowshoes back in the truck the whole time. Just about when we were ready to turn back, another group of hikers (a group of coworkers on a team-building outing) came up behind us. None of us had brought our snowshoes, but they started breaking trail where we left off and we formed a small conga-line; when the person at the front of the line got tired of blazing the trail they let the next person start and cycled to the back of the line.

Gradually a few more hikers joined the group until there were almost 15 of us slowly grinding a trail into the snow.\r The snow at the front was nearly 4' deep when we had to turn around a little short of the lake due to time constrains/prior commitments, but I can't imagine that the remainder of the crew didn't ultimately make it the rest of the way.\r The lesson to be learned: If you bothered to put your snowshoes in the car, you might as well take them with you on the hike.", "date": "Nov 18, 2017"}, {"comment": "Being an 'ol boy from Florida with little snow experience, this hike was both gorgeous and exhausting. Before beginning, I would recommend the following: trekking poles, WP boots & gaiters, warm/wicking clothing, lots of water and tools for navigation.The roads to the parking lot were wet with some snow but drivable. We parked at the Franklin Falls lot thinking the bridge to Denny Creek would be too icy but this was not the case. The trail starts out muddy with some snow patches (no need for microspikes). We approached the first \"landmark\" by passing\u00a0under the\u00a0I-90 bridge which felt very apocalyptic with the grey skies and snow. Continuing forward, we passed through several creeks but all had strategically placed rocks. Even if you missed a rock, you likely would not get too wet since the water is low (given you are not wearing tennis shoes).As someone posted earlier, once crossing the first larger creek, the snow really begins. Fortunately, the snow was fairly compact the entire way from previous hikers/dogs. I would highly advise microspikes at this point.We saw a few hikers without them and they kept slipping in some of the areas. This could be a little dangerous in a few places where there's a steep slope on one side of the trail.About halfway through the hike, the light snow began falling and visibility dropped to 100ft or so.\u00a0If the trail had not been so compact and visible, we may have had to pull out the GPS. The visibility slowly began to drop until we reached the lake.Approaching the final few sets of switchbacks near the pass, the trail became significantly more narrow with one side being a steep slope and the opposite side a deceiving 2-3ft of snow (at some places 3-4ft). This made it difficult (but doable) to pass one another along the trail.We reached the pass with about 20-30ft of visibility where we could only see a handful of trees instilling the\u00a0feeling of a summit (yes, I know it was a pass, not a summit). If you're exhausted, don't fret. The final portion of the hike to the lake is a 150ft descent and the views are breathtaking.\u00a0Few tips once reaching Melakwa lake. First, if the visibility is poor, give about 20-30min as the clouds pass through. Second, be careful around the lake. Portions have iced over and are now covered with snow. You may step on the fragile ice thinking it's still land. Third, keep moving around. The temp at the lake is cold\u00a0especially with the\u00a0wind chill.

The parking lot also had a bit of snow, but I chose a spot where I knew I would have traction to get out.The first section of the trail to the first creek crossing was crusty and packed down. I easily hiked it in boots without any microspikes. The creek was a rock hop across. Once past the creek, the trail became less compacted, often sinking down 1-2 inches and eventually to the ankle. The second creek crossing was also quite easy.Once across the second creek, the trail was covered with fresh snow except for a person who had broken trail ahead of me. I walked in his footprints, usually postholing to the ankle. It was tiring but doable.It stayed like that for quite some time. Once I started ascending to the pass, the snow suddenly became quite a bit deeper. I was postholing to my knee or higher. The person ahead of me kept going in boots alone, but I put on my snowshoes. I'm glad I did because the snow became even deeper as I approached the lake, probably around 4-5 feet. I would be postholing to my waist.I ran into the person ahead of me who had broken trail. He was happy that I brought snowshoes because I compacted the trail for him as he descended. The lake was mostly frozen over and beautiful.On descent, the trail was compacted, but the snow had warmed up so postholing became a problem again.

Not knowing how bad the roads would be at the end of our trek, we opted to park right by the exit 47 off/on ramps and walk to the trail head. Right by the turn on the road to Denny Creek there were two SUV's parked, so we knew there were at least two people ahead of us, breaking the trail. We arrived at\u00a0about\u00a08:45 and started our trek, knowing it was going to be a long one.We hiked up the Denny Creek road about a quarter mile before we\u00a0decided\u00a0to strap on our snowshoes and continue up the main road to the trail head. It was a fun snowy walk, with snow falling and about 2-3 feet of snow on the ground. Snowshoes were much appreciated. If you've never hiked/ walked the two miles to the actual trail head it\u2019s a little sketchy, with westbound I-90 right next to the road. With road conditions what they were I was a little worried a car might run off the interstate and right onto the road we were walking on.By the time we reached the bridge (just west of the campground) the snow had sopped. Spent a few moments enjoying the snow covered bridge and south fork of the Snoqualmie River. We were passed by a group of four people and one 4-legged friend by the time we reached the Denny Creek campground, and where we passed a couple and their four legged friend as well. The four people that passed us, had no snowshoes, and very tiny backpacks. All I could think of is, uh you guys aren't prepared to be out here in the clothing you\u2019re wearing, with the weather conditions...\u00a0When we reached the trail head we were passed by a group of three, also with no snowshoes, and just hiking boots, and clearly not enough layers, one gal was saying she was cold.\u00a0Rain had started falling, and we were already cold, but decided to continue on to Franklin Falls and the last 2 mile stretch we had left. One snowshoe on his way out, stated that when he went up earlier in the morning he had to break the trail. We had just gotten past the Wagon Road Trail when we decided that our safety was not worth a trip to Franklin Falls. The wind had picked up a little bit and was blowing pretty good. The temperature had\u00a0obviously\u00a0warmed up, since snow was falling off of trees in big clumps.\u00a0The seven people who had passed us, had passed us again on their way back, and the trail was snow compact slush and very slippery, even with good snowshoes on. Not far after the Wagon Road junction the trail for narrow with steep slopes, and with slipping as much as I was, it was not worth the last quarter mile to the falls. We decided to start our 3.5 mile trek back to the car and call it a day. We were soaked through all of our layers, even with rain gear on that had been freshly waterproofed. (After a while even waterproofing isn\u2019t waterproof with our lovely Washington weather we have.)Once we got back to the main road back to the car, we passed so many people in just hiking boots, jeans, cotton, no backpacks, no water, and no supplies. We also passed a group of girls with music blaring and their drinks in their hands. None of these people looked prepared to be going on an eight plus mile snowshoe/ snow hike. When we were almost back we pasted two girls in tennis shoes, jeans, and long sleeves, asking us how much farther to the falls it was. When I told them that they still had about 3.5 miles left just to get there, they said that they heard it was only a mile to the falls. I told them it\u2019s about 8 miles round trip, and with the weather doing what it was doing (and avalanche control blasting going on) I told them that if they did not have extra water, food, clothing, etc. that it was best not to continue. They said they had nothing (which was obvious by their caring their purses with them.)The road had turned to puddles, and slushy in the 4 hours we were out there. The mail road off of exit 47 was nothing but standing water by the time we got back at around 1 pm.All in all it was a great day (well the first half, before we got wet and cold from both rain and sweat) for snowshoeing. One day, when conditions are better, we\u2019ll make it to the falls.If you plan on doing this hike in the winter, be aware it\u2019s not the short hike you can do in the summer, the road closure added on 4 miles round trip. And make sure you have enough food, water, winter survival skills, clothing, knowledge, and check NWAC before venturing out into the snow.Once back at the car we changed into our dry clothes and warmed up very fast. No matter how many layer you have once you\u2019re cold, you stay cold, until you get out of your wet clothing. \u00a0\u00a0", "date": "Feb 17, 2018"}, {"comment": "I got a late start hiking here today so I didn\u2019t make the whole trail. There was no other cars when I arrived at 2, there were a few at the Franklin falls lot. The trail has a good amount of snow and sections of streams, definitely bring waterproof footwear.

Before beginning, I would recommend the following: trekking poles, WP boots & gaiters, warm/wicking clothing, lots of water and tools for navigation.The roads to the parking lot were wet with some snow but drivable. We parked at the Franklin Falls lot thinking the bridge to Denny Creek would be too icy but this was not the case. The trail starts out muddy with some snow patches (no need for microspikes). We approached the first \"landmark\" by passing\u00a0under the\u00a0I-90 bridge which felt very apocalyptic with the grey skies and snow. Continuing forward, we passed through several creeks but all had strategically placed rocks. Even if you missed a rock, you likely would not get too wet since the water is low (given you are not wearing tennis shoes).As someone posted earlier, once crossing the first larger creek, the snow really begins. Fortunately, the snow was fairly compact the entire way from previous hikers/dogs. I would highly advise microspikes at this point.We saw a few hikers without them and they kept slipping in some of the areas. This could be a little dangerous in a few places where there's a steep slope on one side of the trail.About halfway through the hike, the light snow began falling and visibility dropped to 100ft or so.\u00a0If the trail had not been so compact and visible, we may have had to pull out the GPS. The visibility slowly began to drop until we reached the lake.Approaching the final few sets of switchbacks near the pass, the trail became significantly more narrow with one side being a steep slope and the opposite side a deceiving 2-3ft of snow (at some places 3-4ft). This made it difficult (but doable) to pass one another along the trail.We reached the pass with about 20-30ft of visibility where we could only see a handful of trees instilling the\u00a0feeling of a summit (yes, I know it was a pass, not a summit). If you're exhausted, don't fret. The final portion of the hike to the lake is a 150ft descent and the views are breathtaking.\u00a0Few tips once reaching Melakwa lake. First, if the visibility is poor, give about 20-30min as the clouds pass through. Second, be careful around the lake. Portions have iced over and are now covered with snow. You may step on the fragile ice thinking it's still land. Third, keep moving around. The temp at the lake is cold\u00a0especially with the\u00a0wind chill. I wish I had a thermometer to see how cold it really was. I usually run somewhat hot with my jacket in 35 degrees and I freezing up there. So it makes me feel like it could have been in the 20's or lower.", "date": "Nov 11, 2017"}, {"comment": "Denny Creek crossings were low enough to ford.

The weather was rainy, but when you have a day off work in the northwest, adventure calls. The road to the trailhead is rough after you exit the freeway. I only recommend driving to the trailhead if you have AWD and good clearance as the snow had a high center. There was a snow-storm in the Snoqualmie region a few days prior, so there was a lot more snow on the trail than anticipated (A few inches to ~3 feet).\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Microspikes or snowshoes\u00a0are definitely recommended, at least for part of the hike. After the first part of the trail, near the power lines, all traces of a trail disappeared as there were no other footprints to follow up the mountain. It was fairly easy to navigate at first due to the posted signs and general route of the trail. As I headed further up though, the direction of the trail became harder to navigate as there are no posted signs, and less man-made constructs. I noticed green reflective circles nailed to the trees as I walked and followed them. After some time, I no longer saw any of the sporadically posted green circles, and I began to doubt my direction. Along with this, I was post-holing up to my knee every so often which slowed my progress. I crossed a fairly steep \"chute\", and continued on. At this point, I came across another chute, but I was entirely unsure if I was still heading in the proper direction. I took into account my dog (who is plowing snow), avalanche possibility in this chute, and the fact that I had no indicating markers that I was still on the trail or going the right direction. At this point, I had to have been over 3 miles into the hike. I was sure the lake was nearby, but decided to discontinue my quest and turn around and retrace my steps back to the trailhead. I was a little sad I didn't make it to the lake considering it is only a 4 mile hike each way, but it was a beautiful trek nonetheless, and I will return when some of the snow has melted.", "date": "Apr 5, 2018"}],

The first snow-covered boulder field, at 3600', is easy to cross. The second boulder field, which comes right after the first, is not. We traversed and climbed the second field, stumbling in and around many mega-postholes hidden under the snow next to boulders. Very slow going.

We were patchy on/off snow for another .5 mile or so until we stopped having to traipse through dirt patches in our snowshoes and hit continuous snow.\u00a0From that point on the mountain slopes steepened and the snow was much deeper, and icy, and wet. When we hit the first open chute we were hesitant to cross. We did some checking for avalanche danger and nervously crossed the field. When we came to the second chute we hesitantly attempted to traverse it, but the trail became less obvious and was covered in snow. It was clear that no one had recently continued on to summit Bandera Mountain.We were concerned about the possibility of snow melt under the pack as well as the fact that we appeared to be on top of a boulder field and were unsure about rock placement and possible collapsing snow bridges, so we opted to turn around and make our way out of the possible avalanche danger zone.On our way down we passed many people who were very unprepared to be in snowy conditions, but were hoping that they were just sticking to the Ira Spring Trail and not attempting to traverse snowy fields in their spring-like clothing.\u00a0I can't wait to return to Bandera Mountain in the summer and make it all the way to the top!\u00a0If you head out on this trail this spring, while there is still snow, please proceed with caution and choose smart over feeling pressured to summit!\u00a0", "date": "9 days ago"}, {"comment": "Wow what a day! Thanks to the previous reports from this week re: snow, spikes, and poles...we were prepared. Thankfully the earlier weather reports for rain/snow mellowed out a bit and we really had a great day weather-wise. A bit of rain, snow, and sleet, but not much of any of those, and no real wind. The trail is nice for a while, typical moderate forest trek with stops to catch our breath.Snow started at 3100\u2019 (yellow waypoint on the map) and we put on our microspikes. It was packed well but a little slushy/slippery here and there, nothing major...until we got onto the exposed ridgelines where one slip or bad step could mean disaster. Passed a few groups coming down who had spikes or snowshoes and reported turning around well before the summit which we had already decided we\u2019d probably do after reading the reports from this week. Like everyone else we met, we were going to go as far as we could. It is very precarious and really dangerous in some places, the trail narrowing to one boot-wide path and even with spikes and poles we slipped and slid. Previous postholes were thigh-deep. We had two gals in our group slip and fall, could have been a big problem but we were all ok. When we got to about 4000\u2019 - almost to the split with Mason Lake - we were done. It takes a lot of mental and physical energy to navigate this kind of terrain. Very nerve-wracking. Sneaker- and jean-clad young men who had passed us on the way up were passing us coming back down, citing their failure to remember to bring boots and spikes and poles as reasons for their descent.Descending in the snow was just as harrowing as the ascent. On the way down we passed a few groups heading up wearing sneakers, shorts, cotton sweatshirts, jeans, and even carrying an infant. After a while we tired of expressing our concerns to them.\u00a0Overall a great challenge. And fun to be in the snow after a few weeks of lowland hikes.===========Us: Six gals ages 51-71, avid hikers/snowshoers.5.6 miles, 1900\u2019 gainTime: 5 hrs total; 3h45m moving according to AllTrails app. Lots of clothing/gear adjustments the first coupla miles and generally we chat and snack and take pee and photo breaks along the way.Tip: When you look ahead and see a group on a narrow ridgeline path/avalanche chute coming toward you, stay in the forest/wherever you are until they\u00a0are off and there is ample room for y\u2019all to pass each other.

Going up the ESE side of West Granite it was a lot slushier, but good crust again once on top.

Overall the trail (foot path in the snow) is relatively easy to follow up to the Source Lake / Snow Lake trail junction, though with 2 moderately difficult creek crossings. Past that point it's steep uphill to the ridge overlooking Snow Lake. I did it on the last day of the warm spell, without traction devices or poles/ice axe. Post-holed frequently one foot, sometimes up to 2 ft deep.\u00a0 Once the temp drops and the snow firms up / turns icy that last steep climb up to the ridge will not be safe to do without crampons & ice axe as it is up to a 45 degree slope.\u00a0More detailed description to follow below. Also see my Strava track of the route below. Out of the parking lot there is a good and easy to follow footpath that follows very closely to the actual trail. In general the trail does not climb very much until the Source Lake trail / Snow Lake Trail junction about 1.8 miles in, and has no switchbacks. About 0.6 miles in you encounter the first creek crossing, which requires a down-climb and up-climb on a 4-5 ft snow bank. I cut some steps in with my folding saw, but they may be melted out by now. This is the easier of the 2 creek crossings. As you head up the valley you'll cross several avalanche debris fields. Those all seem to be from the previous weekend with no recent (last day or two) activity observed. Eventually at about 1.4 miles in you get to the second major creek crossing. Here you have to climb about 6 ft down and back up. On the way out stay as close to the uphill side of the trail as possible. There are a few small trees to hold on to. After that follow the boot track til you get to the Source Lake trail junction 1.8 miles in. The sign is still buried deep under snow. I placed 2 arrows made out of sticks and bark, pointing to the right where the snow Lake trail goes. If you go straight-ish / half left here you are heading towards Chair Peak and Source Lake.\u00a0Following the Snow Lake trail about 1000 ft to the right, where the arrows point, you will see a tree stump sticking out of the snow about 8 ft. Look to your left and head straight up the hill until you get to the ridge. This is where it gets steep. On Friday it was so warm and soft that I had no problem with just running shoes (except my feet got numb from the cold) kicking steps. If it's cold and icy it would be dangerous without traction devices and an ice axe.\u00a0", "date": "2 days ago"}, {"comment": "About 4 feet of snow on the trail all the way through. One way to cross over a stream was a packed snow bridge and which I'm assuming will be gone soon. I had to turn around about 2 miles in because I kept sinking in the snow.

One day we could be hiking on other side of the mountains in\u00a0warm, desert-like weather\u00a0like yesterday, then the next day back to climbing in subfreezing, wintry conditions\u00a0like today.As mentioned in several other reports, the main Snow Lake Trail had been well beaten. No need for snowshoes, but I put on microspikes for traction. Somehow we overshot the Snow Lake Trail junction by quarter of a mile following the tracks before the tracks dwindled. We met a fellow snowshoer Erik on the way back to the junction and followed the boot path up two long switchbacks.Visible boot tracks ended at around 4,200\u2032 right before the exposed, steep slope\u00a0crossing below the water ice-covered cliff wall.\u00a0STRONGLY\u00a0ADVISE\u00a0day hikers, or persons without prior winter mountaineering experience or proper gear to\u00a0TURNAROUND HERE.What was once calf-deep fresh powder from 4,200\u2032 to the pass at 4,400\u2032 had since been replaced with\u00a0hard ice under\u00a0a few inches of snow. Along the way I spotted boot tracks, presumably left from this past week, partially buried in new snow.Some old ski tracks seen in the Snow Lake Basin on the way down, new tracks were later added by day skiers seen on our way out. Great snow consistency today for snowshoeing, not much postholing leading to south ridge of the mountain where most postholing took place. We stayed on or west of the ridge depending on snow conditions.Just as in the\u00a0last few years\u00a0of\u00a0being here to end the year on a high note, Snow Lake hadn\u2019t been visible due to the temperature inversion. But once we got above the cloud level and reached our destination, we were immediately treated with the forecasted sunny weather and phenomenal views all around.\u00a0Last year\u00a0the inversion rose much higher and we had zero views on top.The sight of\u00a0rolling clouds\u00a0carried in from Source Lake Basin\u00a0by fast-moving wind\u00a0was simply breathtaking. More clouds with more elevated inversion this year. We enjoyed a warm 45-minute stay before unwillingly heading back down into the clouds, where temperature decreased by half of that on the summit.Back at the crux on south side of the pass, we carefully descended with the aid of ice axe and large trees. On the way out on the trail, I chatted with a couple of groups before arriving back at the Alpental parking lot at sunset time.Access: Snow Lake TrailheadGear: microspikes, snowshoes, ice ax", "date": "Dec 31, 2017"}, {"comment": "No problems getting to the trailhead in my 2 WD Corolla without tire chains.

The foliage along the road to Skykomish was so pretty. I imagine it only gets better as you reach Stevens Pass and beyond. \r There were no problems reaching the trailhead to Tonga Ridge.

And deeper yet, surprisingly up to the knees deep as we climbed higher. No one had been there recently so we were making new tracks. Once at the top, the views were crystal clear and beautiful. It was so enjoyable to have such great views at 5500 ft elevation and not that far out of town. After taking a nice break exploring around the top, we headed down.

We went further to Sawyer Pass to the junction of Deception Creek/Fisher Lake. There was intermittent snow along the way. We were hoping to go to the lake but the earlier trek through the snow slowed us down and we didn't feel we had enough time to make it to the lake.

As you walk along giant concrete snow banks and experience the rush of the unfinished rail tunnels, you will gain an appreciation for the hard work of our railroad operators.

For those seeking the easiest path, take the first left to walk on the northern loop.\u00a0This way will avoid walking up the switchbacks. For those wishing to burn some calories, stay on the south trail. Definitely worth it to sidetrack to the Windy Pass Overlook. Expect to find a little snow on the north trail.The landscape is dominated by late succession alders, sword ferns, western oregon\u00a0grape and kinnickinnick shrubs. With the recent snow melt, we were able to see lots of trillium, mountain daisy, and skunk cabbage. We were blessed to find a beautiful fairy slipper along the way.

You can see our exact route at https://www.alltrails.com/explore/recording/heybrook-loop.The trail is snow-free and therefore a fine early-season hike.\u00a0The Heybrook Lookout was a highlight of the loop and an excellent place to have lunch.A highlight of the Heybrook Ridge trail\u00a0was seeing the\u00a0section I helped\u00a0repair on a WTA work party last year.\u00a0I was surprised how the area that looked freshly-repaired a year ago now looks\u00a0just as\u00a0used and timeless as the rest of the trail. It's a reminder that trails that look like they've been there forever were once, perhaps even recently, created through\u00a0the work of people like us.We chose to drive the 1.8-mile stretch on Index Galena Rd. and park at the base of the forest road, saving the walk along the road till the end to get back to your car. Consider\u00a0stashing a bike at\u00a0the Heybrook Ridge trailhead so you can get the car afterward without the road walk.The only tricky routefinding was from the lookout to the top of the Heybrook Ridge Trail. We met a woman who had given up and turned back because she couldn't find the way. After the lookout, continue west until the trail\u00a0switchbacks left going downhill, then look for the power lines to your right and bushwhack a few minutes to reach them. There's no real path but you'll see some trampling that suggests that others have walked this way. Once you reach the power lines and turn left, you have to bushwhack for a few hundred feet more, and this is the trickiest part due to some thorny plants. Take your time and you'll soon reach a much cleaner trail.\u00a0Continue for a\u00a0mile or so until you reach a clear trail which descends to your right.\u00a0", "date": "4 days ago"}, {"comment": "Perfect time of year for this one!\u00a0 I've included a couple minutes of video highlights below.Bug free!\u00a0 And the salmonberry, trillium, bleeding heart and wood violets are in full bloom.\u00a0 Lots of white butterflies about and both stellar jays and gray jays up on the tower.I was the only one on the trail, leaving at 8am.\u00a0 Returning about 10am, I saw about a dozen hikers going up.The views of Mount Index, Persis, Philadelphia, Daniel, Crosby, Marchant and Baring are amazing.\u00a0 As well as bridal Veil Falls coming out of Lake Serene.\u00a0 So take your binoculars!", "date": "4 days ago"}, {"comment": "Arrived at the trail right around 9am, and were the second car in the parking lot.

The day was clear and there was a fantastic view of the surrounding peaks at the top of the lookout.\u00a0 We ended up exploring the service road\u00a0and turned back at the service road for a roundtrip hike of roughly 4 miles.Overall, it was a great, short hike for a relaxing Sunday!", "date": "8 days ago"}, {"comment": "Followed this guide for an approximately 1200' elevation-gain loop hike over about 7 miles.\u00a0Got to the Heybrook Ridge trailhead around 10:00 this morning. There weren't many cars, probably because the day was pretty grey. No issues at all driving to the trailhead. It doesn't show up on Google Maps if you search for it, but it's clear where it is once you've driven to it (right at the entrance of the bridge into Index).\u00a0We started walking along Index-Galena Road until the turn on the access road, and it was actually a really nice walk. Many trees, a nice view of the North Fork Skykomish River, little elevation gain, and very few cars driving along it.\u00a0The access road was easy to spot and easy to follow. Elevation gain is steady and not very steep. The lookout had amazing views today of the surrounding mountains. Some semi-low-hanging clouds blocked our views of the tops of some peaks, but overall, it was beautiful!We started down on the Heybrook Lookout Trail for about a quarter of a mile, until we saw power lines to our right. We struggled a little to find a path to the power lines, but made it over. From there, there's a pretty clear foot-path along the power lines to get to the Heybrook Ridge Trail. We had a difficult time finding the Heybrook Ridge Trail -- we almost took an access road because we thought it was the trail\u00a0(the road is a blue dotted-line on the map, I realized after), but continued forward along the power lines and that was the right move. If you're not sure if you've made it to the Ridge Trail, continue along until you are looking downhill at what looks to be a paved road in the distance going from left to right; that's when you know you're close to the trail. You'll know you're there if you hit a point where there's a clearing/vantage point to your left, and a clear trail on your right.\u00a0Some bugs on the trail today, but nothing too bad. Also some water in places, but actually significantly more dry than I expected given the wet weather today.\u00a0", "date": "9 days ago"}],

We stopped at a few viewpoints on the drive up, and they had stunning views. About the last mile or so of road we started seeing a lot of snow, but the road was clear. We got to the trailhead around 1pm. Everything was blanketed in snow with some fall colors trying to burst through. The views of the small lakes beginning to freeze, and Rainier in the background were stunning. Not much elevation change, and the trail was manageable in hiking boots with no traction devices.

I was planning on going to Sunrise, but with the recent snow, I wasn't confident in my route-finding skills, and I didn't want to fall off the back side of Sourdough Ridge. That would have ruined my day.So I headed over White Pass to Ohanapecosh, knowing it was at a lower elevation. Currently there is construction near Rimrock Lake, so you have to detour around the back of the lake - this adds about 20 minutes to your trip. It's still a paved road, though.The campground is closed, so I parked at the gate. Walked to the visitor's center - that is closed, too, but the bathrooms were open, hooray! I did the Silver Falls Loop - it was snow-free, and as beautiful as when I did it this past July. I saw a few squirrels, and only a few people as I was nearing the campground on the way back - they were hunting for mushrooms. I think around\u00a0three miles round trip, nothing too strenuous.\u00a0After the hike, I drove up to Tipsoo Lake, which has a LOT of snow. The road was bare and dry, but conditions are changing quick, so check the road status reports before you go. I sat on a bench in the sun for an hour, reading and snacking, then headed back home over Chinook Pass.I didn't hike Naches Peak Loop, but I wanted to let you know what I saw, in case you are thinking about it. I saw a boot path heading up the hill from Tipsoo Lake, and I saw a boot path going across the highway on the east side of the past, heading off into the trees. So it looks like you could follow it. But if that boot path disappears, or it snows more, you had better know your route-finding skills, especially on the back side.\u00a0I would like to try to snowshoe the Silver Falls trail this winter, but I do not know how far they plow the road once you turn off of Highway 12. Do they plow to the entrance of the park? That is pretty close to Ohanapecosh. But if they only plow to the turnoff, that is three miles more each way. If anyone knows what they usually do, let me know - thanks!The times:I left Yakima at 5:30am, over White Pass and to Ohanapecosh by 7:30am. Back to car by 9:15am. At Tipsoo by 9:45am.\u00a0", "date": "Oct 14, 2017"}],

Cold, penetrating rain for much of the \"up\" hike and then slushy snow until about a 1/2 mile from the lake. The wild picked up quite a bit and we saw at least two large trees blown down across the trail when we returned. (These were not there on the way up.) A few safety matters: look for falling trees when there is wind coupled with heavy moisture in the soil. Second concern was that while I always felt this was a safe high in terms of avalanche risk, two avalanche rumbles closer to the lake made me re-think this.\u00a0 Also, adequate clothing, boots, et al are absolutely needed. We had pretty good clothes, but found ourselves very wet by the return trip to the TH. If we'd had to spend more time outside, the risk of hyperthermia would have been very high. We wore microspikes and carried snowshoes and I would recommend having both.\u00a0 We did not make it to the lake this time because the snow became just too deep (chest high) and we were getting very wet and cold.

The first section of the trail is on an old rocky service road with a slow steady incline.\u00a0 Once you turn off the service road, the trail is still fairly rocky and with the pouring down rain, it had turned very muddy. There are several water crossings that are fine (large rocks and logs to step on), but you could get a little wet. It didn't matter much for us given the downpour!You hit the turnoff to Bridal Veil falls about 1.5 miles into the trail (we opted not to go to the falls). After crossing a bridge through the river you get a fantastic view of the waterfalls. A bit further you start hitting the 20+ switchbacks and staircases. This section is brutal but doable.\u00a0With less than a mile to the lake you will hit snow which gets increasingly deep as you ascend. By the time you arrive at the lake its knee deep in some areas but the trail is compact (although narrow, so passing other hikers was a little difficult).\u00a0It's very cold and windy at the lake but beautiful. We ate a quick snack, took some photos, and watched avalanches roll down the mountainside on the opposite side of the lake before heading back down. The descent is tricky in places with slippery rocks. I used poles and found them useful, but didn't feel I needed spikes. The trail also turned into a bit of a river on our way down. Altogether, it took just under 2 hours from the parking lot to the lake (without a detour to the falls), and we were back at our car around 1:15 pm.

Spent the last 1/3 mile or so in thigh deep snow even going so far as having to climb up\u00a0and over the snow in portions. Never having been there, I just had to educatedly guess where the trail was heading while taking slow and steady steps as to not fall through anything unexpected. A couple with their dogs eventually caught up with me and confirmed with their gps that we were heading in the right direction. The snow was over the poor dog's heads but they didn't seem to mind. Eventually we came upon an icy creek that was difficult to cross safely\u00a0and they decided it best to turn back. I marched on and hoped for the best that I was heading in the right direction. Thankfully it turned into a more knee deep trudge the last ten minutes or so to the lake. The lake itself was covered in snow and Mt. Index so fogged it in, it was difficult to see. Numerous avalanches thundered in the background. It was all still beautiful though and well worth the effort. So quiet and peaceful. A bit after I left a group of five or six were nearing the lake and cleared a pretty good path for those to follow. Much easier going back on the compact snow then the fresh stuff on the way up. Slipped a few times, before deciding to use my trek poles for the first time. Made it at least three times easier hiking through the snow and ice and down all those stairs. Probably passed thirty or so other hikers on the way back down. Good times.", "date": "Jan 20, 2018"}],

I was not entirely sure what to expect difficulty wise because I've seen some mixed reviews but this trail really had all levels dispersed through out. There are some steep switchbacks that will start you off with a tough warm up and then it will even out mostly for a small break with a mix of soft terrain, embedded rocks and knotty tree roots. The entire trail does a great job of giving you benches and rest areas for those those steep switchbacks. I am an intermediate to advanced hiker and felt challenged enough to not get bored (its so beautiful the entire way up) and had my butt kicked a couple times, while my beginner hiker friend did  it just a little more paced. We both got something out of it and the biggest problem for her was the way down. If you have bad knees, the terrain can be difficult but if you take it nice and slow, you should have no problems. Shortly after we left, we did learn that a woman lost her life today falling between the middle and upper falls so please use caution and stay on the trail. In most areas, the ledges have rails but it can be very dangerous if you climb them.

Bob and Barb's trip report of a week ago looked promising at least to the shiny new bridge :-)FR 2880 is accessible with no downed trees on the road, and same for 2870. There are rocks from slides, but today no road obstacles. There was snow pack on the 2870 all the way to the Upper Dungeness parking area, but I would estimate no more than a few inches packed on the road. Potholes weren't too bad. Perhaps the snow and few cars eased the bumps. On the return trip some of the snow was already melting on the road. That said, I wouldn't drive in anything other than AWD or 4WD up there this time of year. On our way out we passed one vehicle coming in, a S&R truck.There was one vehicle in the parking lot when we arrived, and the same vehicle in the afternoon. We didn't see anyone on the trail. The toilet is open, but not stocked.We hit the TH at 10:40 a. Temp was around 35F throughout the day. Less than .5\" of snow to the first bridge, and it looked very fresh and powdery. Really just a dusting in places. As we continued to the second bridge, along the Upper Dungeness River the trail is rockier and there were several frozen/icy areas from runoff that had frozen over. We brought mico-spikes but never used them. We used our poles instead to navigate over the slick areas. A little more snow here, but not more than 1/2 inch. We saw some deer tracks, and little critter tracks on the snow.\u00a0Past the first bridge to Camp Handy just a couple of downed trees no > than 18\" in diameter, and easy to step over.\u00a0The second bridge has some ice on it, and when you turn right after the bridge crossing and head up along the river, there is a slick section. We continued on to Camp Handy arriving at 12:25 p. Getting there, we hung a right at first Y, then hung a left at second Y. When you see the shelter roof on the right, keep going. You'll soon see an obvious worn trail, heading to the right, down to Camp Handy. The trail has steps so it is easier than trying to get down a less-worn steeper hill section that comes before it.There is snow in the meadow, but hard to say how deep. I'd guess less than a foot. We didn't try to wander over to the creek. We ate lunch, departed at 12:40, and were back at the vehicle at 2:00 pm.I would say, thus far and I know this can change overnight, but \"old man winter\" has been kind to the Upper Dungeness trail.

When you come to the newly constructed tunnel, instead of going through it take the trail off to the left of it which will take you to the charming little bridge over Devil's Punchbowl. The water color is so amazingly blue it is unreal! (You can go through the cool tunnel on your return trip back however so don't worry). After you go past the punchbowl and follow the trail a litte, if you watch off to the right and look up you will see what looks like a small cave entrance. If you scamper up the rocks to view it, you will see it is an old train tunnel. (you can choose to go through this as it connects with the main trail on the other side), we did and it was super cool to be in there. (and a little creepy too, but I like this sort of thing).

There are some really nice territorial views starting out. Head down to the river, then continue to hike away from the river. After you make nearly the last push up the right of a lush canyon, the trail crosses over before heading down again.\u00a0 At this point you can stop at an observation knoll and take in a beautiful view up into Gray Wolf Canyon (according to Robert Wood's classic trail book :-) ) before descending.Spring is hopeful along the river, with little green buds appearing on plants along the river. Little areas of snow and sleet nestled here and there off trail speak \"not quite yet\".As the description states, this trail can be muddy in sections, and it was today (Sunday 3/25), but don't let the muddy patches deter you from adventuring to the river stops near trail end. The mud/clay boot sucking sinkhole that we experienced last year as we headed down trail before entering Buckhorn Wilderness is gone. Thank you to the group that repaired this section of trail! No microspikes needed today. A little snow on trail but nothing of note. Gaiters useful. We brought our poles but didn't use them.There were a number of downed trees on the hike - passable by climbing over or crouching under. Most notable (in terms of size, accessibility) mentioned as follows:1. As you make a final decent to the river (after hiking up the right side of creek canyon, then crossing to left, and descending from the observation knoll (~3.2 miles) there are a few switchbacks. On this section there are two trees crossing the trail that you'll need to crouch a bit to get under if you're taller than 5 foot. In collage, picture bottom right.2. At roughly 3.9 miles is a section of caution, slightly above the creek in the moss-rich area near one of two final river camp areas to trail end. A large tree fell toward the river and its root ball took out a section of the trail with it. The trail is passable and not on a precipitous ledge, but the trail was made narrow in this small section. Two top pictures in collage taken on approach and then looking back.3. Past that are two more down trees that you'll need to climb over before getting to the camp areas before the trail ends. Bottom left picture.As for road in, FS 2880 from Palo Alto no problems in AWD, and there is fresh gravel (a nice surprise). Once on 2870 (to Gray Wolf), just before the steel bridge, there is a large muddy debris area on the road where a number of downed trees were cleared (as noted in another trip report). This was obviously a big undertaking to clear this as evidenced by number of branches and cut trees in area.

We left from the new(er) trail head on a beautiful summer-like morning that featured an interesting play of warm and cool air currents swirling through the draws. This trail makes for a nice medium-intensity workout after winter doldrums with a mix of ups, downs and flats. There are a few downed trees on the trail that were easy enough to step over or get around; some muddy spots but nothing too deep or mucky. The Gray Wolf river provides a pleasant accompaniment for the journey and there are plenty of places to stop along its course for a snack or simply to sit and appreciate the beauty of its rushing rapids and deep pools.We did not take the Cat Creek Loop.

Bathrooms at trailhead, no toilet paper during my visit.The trail was beautiful, a bit rocky but nothing too crazy. It's a nice steady incline with long switchbacks rather than steep rapid ones. Even though it was my first time being alone in the wilderness the trail just felt comfortable, and I never had a worry.I had a lot of fun on this hike, getting to the lake was an incredible feeling and it really blew my mind. There were some ladies on the rock lookout so I decided to keep walking a bit further and actually found a log by the lake all to myself and had lunch. I can't wait to go back here. I did about 2hr on the way up and 1hr on the way down. The trail had over 10 cars when I got back on a Monday. Everyone I ran into was very kind.\u00a0All in all, an experience I'll never forget.Stats:6.6 miles1,608 ft. elevation3:09 moving time", "date": "7 days ago"}, {"comment": "Hiked to lower Lena today but went a small stretch towards upper to a large rock overlook.

"comments":[{"comment": "Completed our first backpack of the year at Shi Shi Beach Friday to Saturday! We loved the diversity of the route and its epic views in every direction. For backpacking, due to having to park at the the private lot, figure in not quite an extra mile on the road each direction. We got overcast with some gentle mist/sea spray Friday coming in; steady, solid rain Saturday morning followed us all the way out and then some.***There is a lot of plastic and garbage on the beach. If you are able, please consider bringing a spare bag and packing some out with you!***Neah Bay/Makah Museum/Pat's Place:\u00a0The Makah Cultural & Research Center\u00a0is absolutely worth a visit. We bought our recreation permit here. For non-Makah adults admission is $6. Learning about the deep history of this place enriched\u00a0the privilege of exploring it.On our way home we were glad to hit up Pat's Place in Neah Bay for some Indian tacos, chocolate and coconut cream pie, and laughs.Trail:\u00a0We were hiking after a beautiful week of sun and crossing our fingers that the mud would not be as bad as in earlier trip reports. It was still several inches deep in places and we were glad to have brought along our gaiters. There are several spots where drier side trails are tempting, but the rangers ask that they be avoided in order to prevent further trail widening and forest trampling.\u00a0The old rope setup down from the headland trail to the beach has been replaced by switchbacking stairs and trail, complete with hand railings. Still pretty steep in spots though!Privies: The first toilet, nearest the switchbacks from the headland trail, has had its walls destroyed. Some makeshift obstacles don't quite do the same job. The second two were hard to find, but as the rangers' handout says, \"Don't be a surface pooper!\" (God bless our NPS). We had trouble with the representations of where they were on the NPS handout, but once we realized not every \"creek\" was depicted on the sheet and we hadn't come as far as we thought, we figured it out. The paths to both toilet #2 and #3 are marked with small, bright orange rectangular markers\u00a0that you can see from the beach. We used #3; it was covered in...moss?...but at least its walls were still standing. BYOTP.Creeks:Our Nat Geo and Green Trails maps showed Petroleum Creek and Willoughby Creek. The campsite/toilet location handout we received from the Olympic National Park WIC depicted one \"seasonal creek\" in addition. We encountered two \"seasonals\" (that is, they pretty much dissipated into the sand within 50 feet of hitting the beach) before reaching Petroleum, and a third between Petroleum and Willoughby.\u00a0Once we hit Petroleum we pretty much\u00a0understood where we were, but for a few minutes before that we were a little confused.Petroleum Creek is the only crossing with enough volume to make you have to think about how to cross it (Willoughby was hoppable). We crossed\u00a0Petroleum close to low tide, and were able to get across lower down where it was wider and only maybe a couple inches deep. Coming back in the rain next day, it was higher tide and we had to cross a rocky bit where it was deeper, but still not really too much of a problem in waterproof boots and certainly not anything hazardous. I suppose one could always just kick off the shoes and socks entirely.Wildlfe:\u00a0Point of the Arches was absolutely worth some significant exploration for intertidal creatures like anemones and gooseneck barnacles. Along the whole beach we also saw sandpipers, dunlins, seagulls, ravens, and a returning bald eagle. Several different critters' tracks across the sand as well.Campsites:\u00a0Not being familiar with the beach, the high tide line looked like it came pretty much right up to the driftwood. We were never present and awake for it, so can't verify. Not wanting to find out the hard way whether we were right or not, we searched for a forest campsite just above the beach instead. The one we found was in a chain of three sites, the third of which looked downright apocalyptic. Stove fuel canisters, cutting boards, a fire ring in the woods (supposed to only\u00a0burn fires on the beach and should be disassembled after), bottles and food containers galore, and even a giant heavy frying pan had made their way nearly to Willoughby Creek and been left. We wished we had brought a garbage bag along that we could have hauled more out with.Apart from this mess at the neighboring site, our campsite was beautiful: maybe one or two hundred yards from the Point of the Arches, with a great view and a nearly dry sitting log from which we were able watch our\u00a0tiny hint of sunset through the clouds behind the sea stacks.\u00a0", "date": "3 days ago"}, {"comment": "We got our pass for our overnight in Port Angeles. The rangers provided us a map of the tide and a bear canister. They gave us great instructions!We stopped at the general store in Neah Bay for our tribal pass--good for one calendar year.We had read the previous reviews, but we still just used hiking shoes. They certainly got wet as sections in the last mile were extremely muddy, and sometimes, the best way was through the middle and a shallow stream of water. Sometimes, there was no good way. Plus, since I really wanted to go to the arches, we had to literally cross a river (it is much lower in the summer).It was beautiful on the beach, and we enjoyed lowtide twice! We camped at a pre-existing site. It wasy very nice to see the arches, the beach, and a river from our tent. We saw other fires while on the beach, but it was like we were camping alone. The wood was extremely wet. I think I read somewhere we couldn't bring in outside wood, so check a few sites. It hadn't rained in the morning on our way back, so there was less mudd, but it was still pretty dang muddy! We saw some people in tennis shoes heading to the beach on the trail and knew they weren't gonna make it. Our socks were wet and never dried until we got home.It's worth it!!", "date": "Apr 14, 2018"}, {"comment": "Very muddy! Bring goulash boots. We bought a pair at Walmart on the way to the trail and used them all the way to the beach. Lots of logs and twigs were helpful to stay away from the deep pockets of mud, but keeping shoes dry and clean would be impossible.", "date": "Apr 6, 2018"}, {"comment": "So muddy! Please bring shoes suitable for 6 inches of mud!", "date": "Mar 27, 2018"}, {"comment": "Pics - linked below with sea treasures and critter tracks I couldn't include with only 4 to attach.Road: the road is paved to the trailhead parking lot, which is gravel & in good condition, including privvies. Remember to get your Makah pass at Wahsburn's just after the very well-done and informative museum - worth a stop if you have time! The pass is $10 and good for the rest of the calendar year.Trail: I always forget the majestic, enchanting woods part of this hike, which is alone worth the trip. There are some Sitka spruce that will have your neck aching for days if you give them the awed attention they inspire in me. The first part of the trail has long sections of boardwalk with a few loose boards and which are definitely slick when wet. I love the upside-down V Cantilever Bridge. All junctions are well-signed. After turning right onto a gravel road, the boardwalks stop, and the mud notoriously starts. But as Hikingwithlittledogs notes, the mud this year is not as prolific. There were about 3 good bogs instead of the steady 1/2-mile mire I eagerly anticipated. Boots and gaiters allow you to embrace the bogs in a spirit of prepared adventure, and please do -- the avoidance trails through the woods are making the mud and the woods worse for the wear. Skunk cabbage, Indian plum, and salmonberry were blooming with miner's lettuce and oxalis on the cusp of blossoming. Varied thrush, winter wrens, and chickadees sang counterpoint to the bass of crashing waves.Once at the Park Boundary, those with pets must turn back. We were surprised and delighted by the extensive steps and railings in place of rope-and-mud trails down the 200' to the beach. What a project that must have been! Our thanks to the workers. The privy at the campsites where the trail hits sea level has been damaged and definitely lost any claim to privacy.We saw a stack of garbage someone(s) had apparently carted up from the beach, maybe in preparation for shore cleanup day? We added a few things to the pile and took a few others out to dispose of.The beach was its usual wild & wonderful self. We'd seen whales at First Beach the day before (3/18) and hoped they would appear at Shi Shi, too, but we did not see any spouts. Not that there was any shortage of treasures to occupy our time as we wandered along. In all, this hike has yet to disappoint us. Thanks to the Makah Tribe and ONP for protecting and preserving it for us to enjoy.", "date": "Mar 19, 2018"}],

The road to the upper trailhead appears to still be snowbound. We made good time through the lower forest, mostly on dirt.The trail turns to all snow as you reach the final forested shoulder below the primary chute, it was here that we donned microspikes-- as an aside, it was probably near 10:00a on a warm spring day and the snow in the trees/shade was still pretty firm. The spikes were helpful. At no point did I feel the need to use crampons, although others were. I climbed with trekking poles and only swapped for my axe to glissade.The snow in the chute was soft, but relatively smooth sailing as long as you stayed in the defined bootpack. It's worth pointing out that where the snow was shaded by the rock walls it was very firm, even in warm weather. So if you're on dawn patrol, plan accordingly.Reached the summit before noon with a couple of pitstops along the way!

Take it slow in some places and you\u2019ll be fine. Lower lot was full when we got there around 8:45a. Started at 9am and Enjoyed the easy forest walk. Snow started about a mile or so in so we switched to spikes to make it easier (the snow route in the forest can get steep so these definitely helped).\u00a0Once we made it into the open area, half the avy chute was socked in, and low clouds were all over. The snow was still hard by this point, so we just took it slow and steady going up.\u00a0A major rant though. There was a group coming down while we were going up that I wanted to whack over the head with my poles. Besides yelling and being obnoxiously loud, they were uncontrollably flying down the glissade chutes with no regard to others in front of them so people were having to jump out of the way. Most were still wearing crampons or spikes while doing so (for the love of god people, take them off), and just yelling to everyone how they were crazy so it was ok. Don\u2019t be those idiots.\u00a0We started back down from the summit around 2pm and even though it wasn\u2019t sunny, the snow was incredibly soft. The glissade chutes by then we\u2019re really sketchy, but trying to walk down you were postholing to your waist. The top chute was easier to go down backwards and kick stepping in.

The views from the summit are amazing and well-worth the steep ascent! We drove up from Seattle early on Saturday morning, and started the hike around 8am. No snow on the road until just past the lower trailhead, but the trail was covered in snow almost the entire way. Any kind of car can make it up to the lower trailhead (assuming you don't mind swerving around a handful of potholes).I would definitely recommend getting to the trailhead as early as possible, both to beat the crowds and to avoid hiking in soft snow. There appeared to be about a foot of fresh powder on the mountain, and although it was pretty nice on the way up, it was melting pretty fast on the way down. I wouldn't have wanted to start any later in the morning, and earlier would probably have been even better. We had crampons and ice axes with us, and definitely needed both. Snow shoes would've been nice, too, although not necessary. Got to glissade down part of the way, but as other people have mentioned, it's tough when there are so many people hiking up as you're coming down - best to avoid causing snow to tumble down and hit people in the head.", "date": "9 days ago"}, {"comment": "Driving to the lower trailhead in any vehicle is very doable with minimal problem. There was only 6-10 potholes required me to actually go around and I drive a Prius. I could easily see any kind of vehicle getting to the lower Trailhead without a problem. Unless you have some serious snow capability you're not going to get to the upper Trailhead though because as you park at the lower Trailhead you noticed that the road is covered in about half a foot of snow going to the upper trailhead. The trail starts out nice very well maintained the large pines are beautiful. Your first mile will be an easy calf warm up. The 2nd mile is covered an intermittent snow and has two downed trees which you can easily step over. Once you get done with your second Mile and merge with the upper trailhead you then start to realize what you got yourself into. the trail quickly Steepens to about 40% grade and only get steeper all the way to the top. At this point you'll want microspikes at least, once you get past that quick spurt you'll have a quick relief and you'll see Avalanche chute that you're about to go up. I stopped and had half my lunch there. then the dog and I started up the close to 65% grade Avalanche chute. I highly recommend you use poles at least, and bring an ice pick if you can. And unless you've got legs if steel bring crampons or snow shoes. however I did it with only microspikes and my dog and I had no problems. Now that being said my dog and I are in very good shape. As you climb higher the views only get better and you'll get to the top of the chute in about 45 minutes to an hour and 15 minutes. Once you get to the top of the chute... you realize you're not at the summit yet. You then continue to climb at about a 65-70% grade another 800ft or so through knee deep to hip deep snow. You will then reach the summit and be rewarded with fantastic views of the Southern Olympics, Mount Washington, Mount Rainier and Mount St. Helens. Then I would recommend you put on your snow pants tuck them into your boots and slide down. Just be careful to look out for people coming up before you decide to slide. I made it down in about 5 minutes with my dog coming right behind me. The only thing to watch out for on the remainder of your way down is to make sure you don't walk past the trail to the lower trailhead, if you do you'll find yourself at a map board saying you're at the upper trailhead and you'll have to backtrack up about a quarter mile then take the correct trail. Also I understand there are leash laws, but if you have to have your dog on a leash don't bring them. This is definitely an off-leash hike, having your dog on a leash could endanger you and your dog and other hikers. Fantastic Hike!", "date": "9 days ago"}],

Most of the roadway is actually paved, but the last couple of miles is dirt with periodic pothole clusters. No snow at all even at trailhead.Started hiking around 10 AM with a little snow breaking through a mostly-cloudy day. It's really a pretty section to start with, easy-going along the stream with moss covering everything giving everything that wonderfully soft texture that makes hiking out here so pleasant.Within the first mile there was only intermittent patches of snow and the trail was totally clear. At 1.5 miles it started to cover more and more of the trail until at 2.2 miles I'd had enough and put on the Yaks. At 2.4 miles there was a huge tree down over the trail. Follow around to the right of the root-wad, then sharp left to the other end of a second, smaller tree. Not hard to navigate. There's a few other trees across the trail farther up, but nothing hard to hop over or scramble under.After the big tree at 2.4 miles I really started wishing I'd brought snow shoes. The snow cover was almost total and started to get thick. By the time I reached Shelter Rock Camp some of the trail was covered by 2 ft or more of snow in places, nothing less than 1 ft. Enough people had come this way that the trail was easy to follow though, and the surface snow had been packed enough to walk on top, mostly... Wishing I'd brought snow shoes again...At about 3.7 miles, after resolutely trudging through the snow, I crossed the first snow shoot. It was pretty small with lots of small trees holding it together, so I pushed through. Shortly after I came upon the first big shoot, which would have been a scramble on talus during the summer, but now was a jumble of dirt and snow leading back up to the east shoulder of Buckhorn. With much poking, prodding, and tamping of snow I crossed over the first bit of avalanche but then turned back as the snow depth was just too much.", "date": "11 days ago"}, {"comment": "Made\u00a0 it up to about 4,500' where there is avalanche debris across the trail.Nice views and some sun.\u00a0\u00a0", "date": "Jan 3, 2018"}, {"comment": "Initially, we'd hoped to go to Marmot Pass (starting at the Upper Big Quilcene trail head). However, we turned around a few miles past the Lower Big Quilcene trail head because our Prius wasn't having a good time wi th the icy roads. 4WD, chains, or any more mountainous type of car could probably have gotten at least quite a lot farther. Also, leaving later in the day could have made the roads easier to navigate because\u00a0most of the ice had melted by early afternoon, and we'd been trying to drive around 8 AM.However, we didn't want to wait around for the roads to thaw, so we parked at the Lower Big Quilcene trail head and started hiking along the river. At the junction 2.7 miles in, we turned onto the Notch Pass trail and headed up. We went to the top of the pass and then returned. The pass is not really a destination in itself since it is just a literal passage through the hills, but the trail was quite pretty, and icicles were all over the place and super cool.There was never enough snow to need snowshoes, and we did the whole trail in boots. There was mostly just a couple inches of frozen, crunchy snow on the trail, and the trail was almost always easy to follow. The one place it wasn't was where a huge tree had fallen down, perhaps a half mile or mile after the Notch Pass junction. The tree's wreckage covered the tree completely, and it was so large that walking around the mess wasn't even much easier than just walking through and over it.

Particularly on a rare warm, blue bird day in late October. The trail is immaculate and the pass + Buckhorn Mountain are snow-free right now. One last hurrah before the precipitation surely comes soon to close it down.I thought I might as well do Buckhorn while I'm here to get more commanding views. To do this, once your reach the pass, hang a right on the Tubal Cain Mine trail and within about a tenth of a mile, a boot path takes off up Buckhorn. It took me a few minutes of wandering the flank until I found the path. The path is steep and the footing is a bit challenging due to the loose rock, dirt, and scree. Poles were essential, at least for me. Once on Buckhorn's ridge/saddle, the way becomes easier until the final push up the rocky east summit. I'm not sure I'd hike it again, but it was good to get a sense of the bigger picture up there - where Marmot Pass stands in relation to the rest of the Olympics. On a clear day like today, Rainier, Glacier, and Baker were all visible for the top of Buckhorn, and Warrier Peak demands your attention even more.Alas, no marmots or other wildlife to greet us. Also, I'm not sure if I've ever seen seen the Olympics so dry and brown. Just caught between seasons I suppose.", "date": "Oct 29, 2017"}],

Bring snowshoes.I got a late start leaving the Stevens Pass parking lot at 9:13am. The lot is starting to get more crowded now that the ski resort is opening up. I decided to wear my Akyra GTX trail runners over my heavier boots, which was going to be an experiment when paired up with snowshoes. They ended up working out well.I set foot on a nicely packed down trail and headed out for the day, still just carrying my snowshoes, even though on the return trip, I'd wear them all the way back to the car. The trail starts out flat but completely snow covered. The views of cabins and forests, with the sounds of the highway, slowly faded as I hiked out.Around 3 miles in I came across a group of about 5 people, one of whom happened to be a fellow Explorer Search and Rescue trainee. It's a small mountain world out there :). It was right at this point that I was starting to punch in and posthole one too many times, so I donned the snowshoes, along with the entire group of 5. I continued on ahead (and promptly managed to walk in a circle, oops). Once I got myself back on course I was again behind the party of 5, which I was okay with seeing as they were packing down the trail nicely.I continued heading towards the lake and came across my second human encounter of the day, a solo hiker, heading back to the car, who warned that this wasn't the trail to Lake Valhalla (it was). I stopped and showed him my GPS, expressing my doubts, and we each went on our ways. I think he must have just missed the turn?It wasn't long before I finished the final bit of elevation gain to the overlook above the lake, meeting back up with the group of 5. At this point, some of that group opted to head back, having seen the lake from afar. My fellow ESAR trainee, myself, and two others took it upon ourselves to break some trail down to the lake, heading around the north side first to make for a more gradual descent.At the lake we enjoyed hot cocoa, coffee, snacks, and freshly filtered water for the 6 mile return trip to the cars. It got a little windy, but nothing too bad by any means, and the storm started rolling in as we were hiking out. The trail slowly gathered the darkness as the day wound to an end. Along the way back, I came across two more parties. One came out of the brush about 1-2 miles from the highway, having skied some nearby ridge. The other was almost directly off the highway and was doing some sort of photo shoot. They had their lighting equipment and had decorated some trees with Christmas lights, which was kinda nifty to come back to in the dark.

Arrived at Stevens pass parking lot at 11, parking was almost full. Trail starts pretty easyly, it is flat and broken well, I even didn't use my snowshoe two miles, on third mile I put it on. I met some people on the trail going back, nobody was able to get to the lake. Right before crossing first big stream I passed four people. After this stream trail wasn't broken at all. Two or three feet of snow on it. I decided to give it a shot. Guys, it was sooo tough! I almost had no experience with trail breaking in fresh deep snow, but I got it today. I decided to go mile or so and see how it goes. It went well, but slow and tough. I fell few times in snow, it is not easy to standup when you lying your face down in deep snow :) Finaly I reached second big stream and took do long detour, don't be fooled with my track by snow field. You can cross this stream and go by actual trail, save you time. After that ascent starting... :( Each step was very hard, snow was so deep, every minute I thought about to turn back. Last mile was most difficult, I was tired, ascent was steeper. Half mile before the lake one couple reached me, we talked little bit, they said thank to me for my track and turned back, it was too late for them. I decided to go further. Finally I reach lake viewpoint at 4 pm. Took some food and ran back. I was so glad to go back my own track, it was much easy. Returned back at 6:30 pm. In total almost 12 miles in 7.5 hours, 5 hours from TH to the lake, 2.5 hours back. Great expiriece and great buning hike.

The rain had petered out around somewhere around Barin and the US2 was slightly damp, with occaisonal sunbreaks until the summit - where visibility was a couple of hundred yards due to fog. There were only couple of cars in the lot; it looks like the ski area officially opens later this week. I had absolutely no problems with a 2WD compact. I hit the trail at 0830 and ~40F.The trail down the old RR grade is very well worn. I was the first on the section, and while I could see some snowshoe tracks from yesterday I put mine on as well. Theres one 2.5\" diameter tree and two smaller blowdowns in this section, but they are all easily navigable. The unnamed tributaries marked on GT #176S for both both Stevens and Nason creeks are flowing well with no ice buildup on the edges. Visibility was constantly changing, but never clear. It would drop down to a hundred yards for a few minutes, then clear up to about half a mile or so for another few minutes.Past Nason creek and turning to the north again, the trail was still very clearly defined and reasonably well packed. In retrospect, snowshoes and even microspikes were optional at this point, but I was glad I had packed the trail when I came back down. The tracks I had been following turned around at the top of Nason Creek at 4200' (which is just starting to ice up around the edges) and them my day got a lot harder. The trail is still well defined, but hasn't been trod recently and I was packing down several inches of snow. At about 4600' where the trail turns to the west to start the switchbacks, the packed trail splits to the west and the north. Don't go north, you eventually run into a a pile of blowdowns. Here's where I met a lovely couple and their dog Roscoe, and we hiked together the rest of the way to the lake. They had been following my trail, so they graciously agreed to take point and break trail going farther. They were doing great without snowshoes but I kept mine on. Also, they had the actual route waypointed on GPS, so I wouldn't have to pull GT #144 out of my pack and use my 1:69500 UTM grid reader + GPS. Eventually, we got to the lake - just in time for the fog to move in and drop visibility to a few yards. We worked our way around the lake until it wasn't too steep, then dropped straight through the trees to the shore at 13:45 where my cheapo thermometer measured ~35F. We met a couple of guys who had camped well north and were headed south, and several other groups who had come up from Smith Brook. I enjoyed lunch and coffee and good company, watched the dog chase mountain jays, and the occaisonal break that offered glimpes of the face of Lichtenberg Mtn. We packed up and headed back down at 14:20. I started off on snowshoes but soon took them off - the work we had done packing the trail paid off. They sped off ahead, and I kept plodding along at my own I-wish-I-was-in-better-shape pace.I bonked hard just past the unnamed Nason Creek tributary, and by this time it was getting dark. With my headlight and force of will, I made it back to my car about an hour after sunset at 17:20. My phone decided to turn itself off (with 33% battery left!) just north of the unnamed Steven's Creek tributary, but up to that point it logged 11.71 miles.

Instead of snowshoeing it up the rest of the way, we put chains on the Tacoma which yielded us another 1 mile if that before being stopped dead in our tracks\u00a0because of the 2' snow, so we abandoned the truck, strapped on our snowshoes and headed up to the trailhead. Once we got there we began our traverse across the mountain which ended very abruptly due to the amount of snow coverage on the trail. The switchbacks of Sauk Mountain this time of year is very steep and is almost impassable without the proper gear so without getting too technical in this hike, we decided it was best to turn back around and just camp out at the beginning of the trailhead which still provided stunning views of the shooting stars and an even better view of the sunrise the next morning. Despite not making it to the summit, the trip was well worth it! After this trip I decided it was best to invest in a second set of chains for the front of the Tacoma for added responsiveness and a better driving experience.

The small parking lot was full, but it still didn't feel too crowded.The trail itself is gorgeous - we didn't know what to expect, but it's exposed the entire way, offering gorgeous views of the surrounding mountains, the Skagit River, and all the way down to Hwy 20 below.It didn't feel like nearly 2 miles or 1,100 feet - we were up to the top in around 30 minutes. There are a few little rock scrambles you can do, both on the true summit and adjacent, that offer 360-degree views of Baker, Glacier Peak, and the rest of the North Cascades.We relaxed up top for at least an hour, basking in the sunlight and surprisingly-warm weather, before the relatively short hike back to the car.This is a really great introductory hike for families or people that don't hike often!", "date": "Oct 28, 2017"}],

The seasons transitioned from a foggy fall to a sunny winter after about five minutes on the trail. And while the snow covered boardwalks and wet roots were a little slippery, I only ever lost my footing because of my own clumsiness.The beautiful sunny weather kept the snow occasionally crashing down from the trees in a way that sometimes sounded more like deer walking through the woods than snow falling.

We started at the first parking lot (when coming from Darrington). There was some packed snow/ice in parking lot, but I suspect most cars/drivers would manage fine. There was also some intermittent snow on the trail. It was well-packed for the most part and two adults + toddler handled just fine in nothing but hiking boots. We did also do the additional Murphy Creek stretch -- at this portion of the trail there is a large tree that has recently fallen across the trail. It's a bit more of a challenge to climb over than most, but can safely be done. I think many people may have turned around at that point because beyond that tree the snow was definitely less traveled and not as compact. This is the only stretch where snowshoes may have been beneficial. However, it is a short stretch and we were still able to manage fine in just hiking boots (with toddler on my husband's shoulders). Maybe most remarkable was how quiet the trail was. For a gorgeous, sunny Sunday I suspected the trail might be a little busy.

We set our sights on McCallister Camp with an eye on snowshoeing up further, even into Fisher Basin if possible. We kept uttering \"no snow below 2000 feet,\" fully believing it because we all live in the North Cascades and have watched the snow melt up the hills. Of course, this was wishful thinking.\u00a0We hit the trail about 11 am on Saturday, climbing over the rock piles the National Park blocks colonial creek campground entrance with. Immediately we were met with several inches of snow as we trudged across what seemed to be a mile of parking lot to get to the actual trailhead. That accomplished, we thought the trees would have less snow, which was partially true, but we continued to encounter snow in open spots along the trail before we crossed Thunder Creek to Thunder Camp. It was a beautiful day, and despite the snow, we enjoyed the songs of American Dippers, Varied Thrush, and Pacific Wrens on our way along the calm stretch of Thunder Creek.\u00a0After Thunder Camp it became apparent that we'd have more snow than we expected. Clearly the valley is colder and more sheltered than where we live around Diablo Lake. No big deal, we kept stumbling along, passing Neve Camp (which was completely free of snow) and the turn off for 4th of July Pass. It was a beautiful day and we had peakabo views off to Primus Peak up-valley and looking back at Colonial Peak. Some stretches of the forest were completely snow free until about halfway to McAllister but soon we were mostly trudging through snow, post holing with our heavy packs (we planned on 3 nights up there).\u00a0The ~7 hike up to McAllister Camp ended up taking us around 5 hours with breaks, not bad considering all the snow. However, we arrived and discovered the bridge to McAllister was out and decided to camp at the stock camp because going further to other camps would just mean more snow (we'd originally hoped to try for Junction Camp). Clearly we were the first to arrive out here and weren't expecting anyone to arrive, particularly not stock. (Hilarious to find ourselves camping in snow with huge mosquitoes about!)\u00a0Day 2, April 1 was full of mixed rain and snow, but by the end of the day had transitioned to snow which increased\u00a0overnight. By April 2, we had 3 fresh inches of snow, but the expected storm event had passed and we got ready to head up toward Fisher Creek and the wetland area that sits along Thunder Creek above Tricouni Camp. It was beautiful to walk through the forest when the snow on the trees was warm enough to sluff off but not melt. We got off trail and explored via snowshoes from Tricouni Camp. Lots of wildlife activity up there. The beginning of the wetland was quite striking, particularly paired with the massive cedars that sat at the bottom of the area, clearly enduring hundreds of years of floods that periodically overtook the forest edge.\u00a0April 3, the hike out, arrived sooner than we'd have wanted. With wet boots, wet tents, and slightly less heavy packs we headed out. Spring was edging into the drainage, despite the snow, and as we left a single Violet-green Swallow was tilting over the bend in Thunder Creek below the Stock Camp. It was a great weekend but not the for those looking to get a dry, easy backpack in. If you try this hike this early in the year, be sure to have gaiters and more realistically snowshoes. It was completely worth the slog!", "date": "Mar 31, 2018"}, {"comment": "Don't always believe the USFS\u00a0for campground and trail status.\u00a0 We made a huge road trip to Colonial Campground off Hwy 20 because their website stated campground was partially open, so did their voice recorder, but gate was closed and a foot of snow wouldn't have allowed entry even if the gate was open.\u00a0 As far as the Diablo Lake Trail, it was under a foot of snow so we decided to forgo it and try to find another option to camp and hike.", "date": "Jan 13, 2018"}, {"comment": "Spent two nights at Thunder Camp which is a quick one hour hike from the trail head.\u00a0 Great sites there and a good kitchen area.\u00a0 Saturday we day hiked\u00a0 6 miles to McAllister and stopped off at Neve camp.\u00a0 We like Thunder Camp better, but did not spend a lot of time investigating all of the Neve camp sites.\u00a0 The hike along Thunder Creek is flat and easy.\u00a0 The trail is wide and soft in many areas and a real pleasant hike.\u00a0 \u00a0 We hiked to McAllister camp which is across the other side of the bridge over Thunder Creek.\u00a0 The creek has beautiful clear water and the rocks are gorgeous at the bridge.\u00a0 It looks like a great place to jump into the creek on a hot summer day.\u00a0 McAllister camp\u00a0is a premium spot with lots of wide open spaces and large kitchen area with a steel stove over the fire ring.\u00a0 I plan on going back in the summer.", "date": "Nov 19, 2017"}, {"comment": "My wife and I decided to spend 5 days hiking Thunder Creek for our 25th wedding anniversary. We left Monday 8/7 heading for McAllister camp. It was a 4 hour hike for us with heavy packs. The trials are well maintained, the bridges beautifully built and scenery even with the smoke haze was amazing. McAllister is a great camp site. Thunder camp and Neve are so close the the trail head I may be able to still make them for my 50th anniversary. After a night at McAllister we went up to Junction. The first mile is pretty flat but the next two up to Junction are fairly steep. I would not take small children or beginners this far, but intermediate and above will find the views worth a few hours of sweating up the switch backs. We spend two nights including our anniversary at Junction and Wednesday we had the entire site to ourselves. The water is a trek down hill and back but the creek is stunning, and as the camp site is pretty exposed it got HOT, so the creek was a nice way to cool down. Thursday we made it back down the trail to Tricounty in just over an hour. It's well shaded and though the creek is close (to the first camp site) it's a steep trek down and back to access it, step warily as the trail is narrow and giving way in a few spots. We hiked from Tricounty to the trail head Friday in a little over 4 hours, which I thought pretty good for us middle aged trekkers lol...Some highlights for me were the simple raw beauty, and appreciation for the work to cut this trail, and 2 full days alone with my wife in the wild. We also ran into a group of WWU students and being an Alumni myself, this made my day, they were so nice, even inviting us for cinnamon roll after dinner. A great group of young folks. My only low lights were the flies and the smoke haze. 3 species were pretty intent on making a meal off us. Bug spray kept them from staying on you but nothing kept them from landing on you. The hotter you were the more they liked you, and the big ones can make it thru an cotton T-shirt. Views were amazing but would have been crisper if the haze were not ever present. I would love to try this hike again in the Fall as the cooler temps would make it a more enjoyable trip overall, or at least less sweaty.", "date": "Aug 7, 2017"}],

The snow on the road that early in the morning icy enough to pull your car in directions you don\u2019t want it to go when the road is only 12 feet wide. We decided to get an early start and ended up being the first group starting the trail at 7AM just after first morning light. After weighing our options we decided the weather was good and we started early enough to try a route neither of us have tried before. Pat got a GPS route from a skier that had done the hike a few weeks earlier using the Gaia app on his iPhone, isn\u2019t technology great? We kept a map just in case but didn\u2019t end up needing it due to our GPS giving us perfect signal the entire time. About a mile before the trailhead we started heading straight up through the trees. This route was great because, even though it\u2019s steeper than the normal winter route, it\u2019s more straightforward and cuts out some mileage. Our legs kept us pumping through the dense forest up to about 4800 ft where we decided to strap on the splitboards and continue ascending. Skiable snow starts at about 4200 ft as of right now but it was rock hard first thing in the morning. After getting above the trees at around noon a snack break was long overdue and we decided the view of Hidden Lake Peak was a good picnic spot. It was an incredible day, not a single cloud in the sky overhead and no sign of bad weather moving in. We got to the saddle shortly after and debated our options, a high traverse of the saddle and risking some cornices falling on us or a low traverse and adding another 30 minutes but having a much safer time. Avi concern was low for the day but we still tread lightly since the saddle is very seldomly touched during the winter. So we split skied as far as we could and rounded the ridge to finish our last part of the climb to the objective. We had to switch from split to A-frame and back a couple more times before we could strap in finally for the last part of the ascent. It was about 3PM when we finally reached the lookout with plenty of time to chill and settle in before sunset, the entire place to ourselves, the bluest of skies above us and the most beautiful view in the North Cascades within grasp. I love this place. I fired up the Jetboil and we restocked our water supplies with freshly melted powpow. As soon as the sun dipped over the Cascades we grabbed our Sony\u2019s and started shooting every angle of the mountain range physically possible. The sky was on fire, I\u2019ve never seen those shades of pink, purple and orange in such an incredible ensemble. A view like that will humble you unlike any other experience in life. We checked our photos and got some more stoke on the incredible sunset shots we took and then went to bed immediately. It was 20F in the cabin but our full ski get-ups, some fresh socks and our 30degree mummy bags kept us warm enough to pass out as soon as we hit the bed. And yes, there is a two person bed inside the lookout, maybe 3 if you\u2019re feeling frisky. Anyways nature called me at about 8:30PM so I slapped my boots back on stumbled outside for a quick whiz. As I peered out into the darkness the sight of 5 headlamps stunned me. What are they doing? It\u2019s 3 hours after sunset and they just traversed the sketchiest part of the tour with headlamps. I beamed my 350 lumen headlamp straight at them and strobed it until it caught their attention and signaled back. So we left a light on to lead their way and I hopped back into my bag to wait for our new guests. The first dude rolled in shortly after, thank God they aren\u2019t snowshoers. The group of 5 skiers and splitboarders were from British Columbia and did the Hidden Lake tour for their 3 day weekend. Needless to say we made some new friends that night, passing around the Fireball and boxed wine they so kindly hauled up the mountain and sharing our stories from the day. After a good nights rest we woke up to sunrise, boiled down some more snow and strapped back in. Said our goodbyes to the new homies and headed back down the icy slope back to the saddle. We hit a few patches of powder on the way down and decided to get a few shots of pow slashes with the breadth of the Cascades in the background. The skies were as clear as the day before even though the weather predictions called for 70% chance of precipitaion. It made this trip about as perfect as it could be for being so early in the season still. The descent was so awesome, we had untracked powder until the trees got too dense to even ski. I loved our route for the ascent but for the descent I\u2019d say stick with the normal winter route, it\u2019s much less dense tree skiing, only thing you have to worry about is not skiing past the trail back to the trailhead. To be honest the snow in the trees was awful. That early in the morning it was much too crunchy to enjoy but we leafed down back as far as we could, A-framed one last time and walked the remainder of the way back to the truck, ingesting everything that had just happened with some distance between us. This is my favorite place in the PNW, there is a reason most people don\u2019t finish this winter objective, it\u2019s rough and there\u2019s a lot that can happen in such varied terrain as this. I hope this helps you get a day or 3 at the lookout safely with a good weather window. You need to do it whenever you get a chance.

Attempt number 3. Success.It was kind of challenge for me, I tried to get to the lookout two times before (May and November), two times in snow, two fails.The initial plan for today was relax and enjoy snowshoe around Artis Point, but yesterday evening when I was checking reports I found on alltrails.com that somebody put 5 stars for Hidden Lake trail 5 days ago, it was enough for me to change my plans and try Hidden Lake again. Despite great weather I was not sure if I can make it, I still remember how much snow and avalanches was in May, but I decided give it a shot.Came to trail around 10:30, actually I didn't get to trailhead even on AWD and parked mile or so before TH, 6 or 7 cars already were there. I reached TH in 40 mins and tired, it was difficult to go by snow, decided put on snowshoe after forest part. Forest part was easier, since less snow there, you can do in hiking boots, but gaiters recommended. Met two people going back, they done forest part of the trail and turned back.Once I reached basin area I starded to follow by ski track, it was not easy, but doable in snowshoe which is a must at this part. I folowed ski track by right side from the stream, when actuall trail goes by left side. There are few avalances already came down, snow looks stable and solid, but anyway pay attention. Clibmed up to second avalanch, which came from the top and turned left to actual trail. Then did couple switchbacks and crossed this avalanch again toward to travers part of the trail. Despite hard and stable snow it was little bit scary to walk by avalnches, but I decided to go, maybe not too smart.Travers part was very nice and much easier! View was gorgeous, clear views of peaks around, mt Baker, sun, snowshoe. Btw there are some steep slopes on this part as well, I even used iceaxe to go throug it, but as I said I followed by ski track, maybe it possible to find less steep route.Once I reached end of the travers part I saw many snowshoe footprints at this point I realized that it should be some winter route. Definitely! I've seen many cars but met only two people, and ski track I followed by was few days long.From this point there are few snowshoe track\u044b - first is regular trail, second goes to hidden lake peaks. I climbed up by second one, but at this point I did't know that it goes to the peaks, i realized it lated once I got closer. I didn't get to the peak, because it was already 2:30 pm and I had not so much time. I turned right towards to the lookuout, getting closer I've seen some people doing travers by peak to the lookout. In some report guys called this part \"do it or die\", kind of true :)So, I reached lake viewpoint, then I took one of the snowshoe track up, travers part to the lookout is very steep, if you will go there you need to be very careful. I put of basket from my right pole and used it as iceaxe, before doing next step I put it deep in snow.Finally I reached lookout, there were five people and two dogs, they came for overnight. They told me about winter route, it is shorter and much steeper. But! it much safer from avalanch standpoint since it goes through forest and there less snow now. So, if you go tomorrow or before next snowfall you can go by regular route, after snowfal basin area will be risky, but you can try winter route. But as I said it is very very steep espesially at the beginning (from road to lookout)I took some food and photos and went down by regular route. Yeah, views were just awesome!On my way back I met three people going up, they came by regular route as me. So, I took winter route back, first half was easy, since I went down, moderate level of snow, good snowshoe track. Second part was more tough, slopes were much steeper, lots of fallen trees, I lost track little bit, because snow disappeared and I just followed direction to the road. Finally I reached the road, walked down to my car and went home.Finally I can cross Hidden Lake Lookout trail in my list as completed.More photos here https://photos.app.goo.gl/1jEu7aOUPemxAxgv1", "date": "Dec 9, 2017"}, {"comment": "Today was my second attemp to get to Hidden lake lookout, failed again, and again in snow ( I need to hike it in snow free season.Road as always - bumpy, but passable. Started from TH at 11:20, there are were two cars before me. Forest part is pretty easy, less amount of snow. Fun starting at basin area. Once I reached it I realised how it is different from what I seen in April when I tried it first time, today I seen many trees, bushes. In april everything was under avalache. I followed by someone else track, that helps a lot, then I reached those guys, they were on skies going up for overnight. They said they met one guy, who turned back, because he could not find trail after basin area. Soon I reached the point where that guy turned back and I decided to try hit the trail. This is actually was my first expirience when I am the first one on 2 feet snow trail. All snow hikes I did before I followed by some one else track. The bad thing that I didn't see this trail before, in April it was just solid snow field and you just need to take direction, not the actual trail. Despite lot of snow, it still puffy, boulders still there and you need to go very carefuly, that's why I went very slow trying to figure out right where the trail is. I used alltrail app, checked gps every minute to check my position, I spent more time than expected and reached lake view point at 3:10. In addition I want to say that all my way up snow was just crazy, and visibility was awful. Then I realised that I need at least hour to get to the lookout, but I even wasn't able to see it. I also counted time I need to get back and decided to turn back. On my way back I met six people going to lookout for overnight.Hope to get to the lookout next time :)PS. Hiking poles, gaiters, navigation is a must, crampons/spikes/snowshoe might be helpful as well.I lost kershaw knife, probably forgot it on one of the boulder close to lake view point, please ping me if you found it.\u00a0More photos here\u00a0https://photos.app.goo.gl/HyCtRsMxNLM4QK7w2\u00a0", "date": "Nov 4, 2017"}],

There's a couple of inches of snow in places as well, but easy to cross if a little slippery. I was glad that I had good tread on my boots. There were only a few folks at the glacier although many more on Sahale Arm and the Pass. One can expect a lot more on a sunny day before Labor Day.

Once past the switchbacks, the scenery explodes. Gorgeous at the pass, not too many people around on the first day of fall. There was\u00a0a little bit of\u00a0snow and the fall colors were popping. Saw a couple black bears and lots of pikas. Some hikers came down from the glacier camp and said there was about a foot of snow up there.

I have been planning to see larch madness at their peak before they fade away this year. Recent snow have made many great fall trail hard to navigate as per trail reports so we wanted to do something which would not require too much effort and blue lake seemed perfect from recent trip reports.Reached blue lake trailhead around 12:30pm after long drive from Seattle downtown. Parking lot was full and cars were parked along roadside but fortunately someone was leaving so we got a spot. Rainy pass trailhead was even more crowded as we passed it. This is a popular trail with heavy traffic\u00a0but people\u00a0were generally courteous and friendly in sharing the trail. Restroom at the trailhead is out of service and note on it suggests using Washington Pass Overlook restrooms.The trail is not tough but there are sections of trail which are steep and would be difficult without spikes and/or hiking poles. We saw bunch of people in their\u00a0sneakers struggling to cross such sections specially while coming down. I would strongly recommend taking microspikes with you. Definitely helps you enjoying the vibrant colors on trail rather than concentrating on avoiding slipping. You go through forest and before less than a mile the first meadows appears and you can figure out how beautiful it is going to be. The larches has started shedding the needles. With wind, the falling needles looked so blissful and calming. Once you are at lake you can decide which direction to explore the area and we chose the one on the left which still had sun. Had lunch in sunshine appreciating the beauty around us and then headed back. Traffic on trail slows you down but the beauty around you makes it all worth it.Someone in previous trip report mentioned that one should arrive at the lake before 2pm as lake doesnt look blue after sun goes below the mountain level. I would completely agree with that I would even recommend to reach even earlier. We reached at 2:10pm to Lake and there was 5 min sunlight left at lake. Plus larches look more beautiful with sunlight on them.Monday has sunny weather forecast as well before it turns all rainy and snowy again. Hope people will be enjoy last few days of larch color electrifying the north cascades.", "date": "Oct 15, 2017"}, {"comment": "Arrived at trailhead at 8am. It was a 3 hour drive from Bothell. Hwy 20 was white with frost, but didn't have any issues with travel in my RWD pickup. Parking lot for trailhead was also icy, but as long as you are careful, there won't be any issues. At the beginning of the trail, there was about an inch or two of compact snow/ice. By the time you get to the lake there is at least a foot of snow. Definitely recommend microspikes. People hiking without them looked like they were having a challenging time ascending. It took me approximately 90 minutes to reach the lake, but I was stopping a lot to take photos. The sun still hadn't come over the mountain, so spent at least an hour hiking on the trails above the lake awaiting the full sun. This hike is super easy and doable for just about anyone. Not much of a climb, so not much of a workout. But if you are coming for scenery, this hike is just about unbeatable. The classic North Cascade scenery is visible in all directions. Extra pretty right now with the snow and larches that are showing off their glowing gold color. Guessing this may have been the last weekend of the year that the trail is reachable with the colder and wetter weather coming.", "date": "Oct 15, 2017"}],

Pretty much straight up through the woods for first half, then, then a glorious ridge walk the rest of the way over some intermediate peaks. A few spots on the later part of the trail almost felt like some light scrambling, but nothing too challenging. The weather made for great hiking, but is definitely pushing out the start of ski season. Snow was almost non existent, even at 6,500 ft! Only present in shaded areas and is melting fast. I didn't once come close to putting on my spikes or gaiters. Also to note, there's no water source, and limited snow to melt, though we did find enough at the end of the trail to make some coffee and meals, though had to hunt for a shady spot on edge of ridge.

The trail starts off with a climb right away for about 2 miles in the forest. Then, suddenly you pop out to the ridge with Mt. Baker greeting you. To the left, you can see the beautiful Shuksan. From here on, it's a series of rolling hills with multiple forks. Read WTA description to find out where each turn will take you. \r Snow - There are patches of snow here and there (a little bit before hitting the ridge and on the ridge) but nothing crazy. We made it just fine with trail running shoes. We did bring spikes though. Just in case. \r Bugs - Only some grassy parts of the trail. Not bad at all but saying 'No bugs' would be a lie. \r Water source - For those who want to camp here, as far as we can tell, there is no water source (and with current amount of snow on the trail there seems to be no hope making water out of it).", "date": "Oct 28, 2017"}, {"comment": "Hiked with my beautiful Husky and we are so happy we did!

About .5miles into the hike we hit patches of snow and both my husky and I were so excited! A mile into the hike is when the snow covered trails began!

Road is clear, though the ever-present potholes demand slow and careful driving. Right from the beginning the trail is wet. There are sections that are more stream than trail and the creek crossings are quite full. Wear waterproof shoes and bring extra socks!Around the midway point, snow begins to cover the trail. It\u2019s melting out and the packed down trail is slushy and slippery at times. I made it without traction, but it might have given me some more confidence in my steps had I put it on. One section of note is a snow covered bridge about a quarter mile from the lake - the snow has melted out and created a very narrow \u2018beam\u2019 of slick snow three-feet deep above the wooden bridge below. Crossing takes concentration, care, and balance.There was significant avalanche activity on the far side of the lake. Right now would not be a good time to attempt a walk around the whole lake; it\u2019s definitely not a good time to walk out toward the middle. The ice is melting out so even the edges of the lake are a bit treacherous.Got lucky and enjoyed a sunny break at the top, ate a snack, and headed back down trail.

Gaiters, since the snow is so soft in many places now that your leg is going to go for a lovely refreshing dip. Trekking poles of some sort won't go amiss either, and if you're into it, give snowshoes a try, it might be fun! (Or exhausting!).\u00a0Sorry all the pictures are a little dark and grim looking.

Before crossing the bridges, make sure everyone is prepared to keep extra close attention to their footing, and remind people to go slowly and carefully. It's a beautiful hike, but this is the one hazard that seems most significant, and I can easily see the bridges being a deal-breaker for some less confident hikers.\u00a0I don't have a picture of the tougher bridge, didn't take one.

As previous reports have mentioned, it can get windy at the lookout, so bring a jacket if you want to hang around. When we got to the lookout, a previous group had already opened the shutters and storm door when we got there. As we were the last group out, we made sure to close them back down per the instructions on the door and replaced the storm cover.\r(As an aside, there's a tripod stashed in one of the corners which was very handy for taking group photos).\r One thing to beware of is the stream crossing about 0.7 miles into the hike. When we crossed it on the way up it wasn't too bad. Just keep an eye out for the rock cairns that mark the trail. However, on the way back the afternoon heat had melted some snow and the stream was flowing much more rapidly. It was much more difficult to cross.

As of now, the parking lot is closed off by a wall of snow, but there is a lot of road parking.\u00a0We hiked clockwise (we went left of the trailhead sign rather than straight) and then it was off to the races after that. From the second we hit the trail there was snow. Going clockwise allowed us to gradually climb up rather than having to go up the much steeper western side of the bowl. The trail was packed down really nicely until about 1/3 of the way up to where people just started to turn around because nobody wants to try and blaze a trail in 3 feet of snow. (Exposed areas had about a foot of snow whereas areas with a lot of shade or cover had roughly 3 feet of snow)However, we did exactly that. This was when our group put our snowshoes on and started chugging up the mountain. We used Maps.me to follow along the portions of the trail that were not obvious (most being obvious). Once to the top of Maple Pass (the high point) we took a lunch break and enjoyed the views of the surrounding peaks. Having put the hardest part of the trail behind us, we then started to make our gradual descent down to where the other side of the trail stopped. We were met with beautiful\u00a0views along this ridge.\u00a0Once we met up with the other trail it was smooth sailing until we hit a fresh avalanche (we heard several while hiking). At this point there was what looked to be a 300-500 foot drop off straight down into the lake (I tried not to look down). Be very careful here. This was the last trouble spot. The eastern facing slope of Heather pass area was mostly snow free and we took off our snowshoes here. Here it was mostly just a creek running down the trail.\u00a0Overall fantastic hike. DO NOT GO IF YOU ARE UNPREPARED. We saw about 20 people going up at roughly 3 pm (2-3 hours before sundown and 30 minutes before we got back to our car) in mostly tennis shoes and the occasional boot. Some didn't even have water.

My friend and I made it to the top then went back down the way we came because we didn't have snowshoes and I assume the snow on second 2/3 of the loop would be unmanageably deep for people (like us!) without the proper gear. Lake Ann looked quite pretty, however we only saw her from afar and didn't actually make it down to her frosty shores. The trail was totally covered in show the whole way but it isn't to hard to follow as long as you're paying attention. The giant boot tracks should also help as well.

Going up was a bit of a challenge due to wet snow / ice, so I'd recommend poles and/or microspikes; I managed to do just fine with poles. Once I got to the top of the ridge the snow turned into slush. Navigating this can be tricky, so be sure to bring waterproof boots (gaiters optional) if you want to keep your feet dry. I made it down to the north section of the trail around 5:30 after taking plenty of photo breaks, waited around for sunset, and snapped a few nice photos. I then jogged back down to my car in the dark. Most of the north section of the trail to the parking lot wasn't snowy; it had plenty of sun exposure so it all melted.

I've described the parts of the trail I saw below.As others have mentioned, the most challenging part of this hike right now is keeping your feet dry. The first mile involves numerous stream crossings. Mother nature has reclaimed much of the trail as temporary stream bed. Weden creek is knee deep (on a 6'4\" man) and flowing fast. You'll want good boots and good rain pants.The snow starts about halfway up the switchback section. I didn't find the snow TOO slippery. But I understand why people may want microspikes or poles, especially on the downhill and side hill sections.Also keep in mind that you will be scrambling over snow-covered boulders to get across the multiple cascade crossings after the switchbacks. Keeping your hands warm and dry through this is also a challenge. I was thankful to have my winter ski gloves with me.Shortly after the third or fourth cascade crossing, I followed what I assumed to be the trail up to a frozen tarn. I quickly lost the trail in the knee-deep snow.

We got to the trailhead at 11:15 and we were the last to arrive that day, it seemed, and there were about six or seven cars in the parking lot already. Whatever snow was on the road from the last trip report has since melted. The road is pothole-y with some sizable puddles, but I would imagine most cars could make it to the TH just taking it slow. We opted for the lower Elliot Creek trail on the way there, which is in remarkably good shape right now. There are definitely a number of tricky stream crossings with the water running as high as it is right now, one of which seems to have turned back the couple that was hiking behind us. Waterproof boots are definitely necessary, but I didn't use my gaiters. It would have been helpful to bring my poles if only for added balance on some of the crossings, but we managed without. Parts of the last stretch up to the lake are just walking through a stream running down the trail. We stopped to look at the river and its waterfalls, which are just pumping and churning right now. We got to Goat Lake in about 2.5\u00a0hours and the temp had dropped enough that the light drizzle was more of a freezing rain/trying to become snow type of precip. No snow on the ground anywhere but it was clear it was snowing just a little bit higher above us. The lake was a different color than I've ever seen it - almost army green. Stopped long enough to eat some lunch and take some pictures and then started back down. We took the upper trail on the return to maximize our daylight and check out the waterfalls we figured would be running high this time of year (of which there were several beautiful ones!). Per usual, the upper trail was a quicker and straighter shot back to the car, but it definitely still had some challenges with stream crossings and flooded sections of the trail. We were back to the car in two hours, just as it was getting dark. Beautiful day out there!\u00a0", "date": "Nov 24, 2017"}, {"comment": "Mostly dry and completely snow free hike today to Goat Lake.

It\u2019s a long wander along the river through mossy woods with access to some truly spectacular waterfalls. The trail is a bit muddy at times, with a few trees down, particularly after the third waterfall. One spot of note is a section of a downed cedar that has completely covered the trail. Folks have been going over around the top of the tree section, which seems stable, but it will likely need to be dealt with soon. There\u2019s also a low spot that\u2019s elevated walkway has broken down that\u2019s got some substantial mud. The falls are truly impressive right now with trillium, salmon berry, and bleeding heart blooming along the trail. We started around 9:45, after making our way up the road to the trailhead. The road is fairly rough with consistent potholes, but if you take it slow, most cars should be able to make it. The lot is small, but around 10:00 on a Sunday parking was easy. We walked about 4 miles up the trail, with no real destination, making it back to the car around 2:00pm. The lot was full, with cars parked along the road. All in all, this is a delightful trail for grey days while the snow melts. Enjoy!", "date": "yesterday"}, {"comment": "As previous trail reports have mentioned, the forest service road is in rough shape. I'm certain that potholes are much more effective then speed bumps in slowing folks down. I was able to make the three plus miles\u00a0to the trailhead in my SUV, and there was a compact car in the lot. Met the owner of the car at the first falls and she mentioned that they almost bottomed out three times, and had a close call near the end of the road.I left a little later in the morning and got to the trailhead at about 1pm and there were only seven vehicles in the parking area. There was a little mud in the lot and at the beginning of the trail, but it was relatively dry overall considering that it has been so rainy the last several weeks. There is one tree hanging over the trail that you will have to duck under where water is running down, be prepared for a little sprinkle near the start.\u00a0Just past the campgrounds\u00a0the first waterfall can be seen, and a few minutes later you are at the feature falls. \u00a0The heavy spring thaw is making for a spectacular show. A short scramble down to the large boulders will give you an even better view of all the waterfalls.The buds are just staring to pop up on the forest foliage. In a few weeks time they should be in full bloom. The swamp lanterns are blooming, and I even ran across a little newt.Most of the trail is in good shape, looks like the trail maintenance folks have done some water management on the path recently. There is one large tree that is down that has been cut with a notch so folks can climb through. There are also a couple foot bridges over some deep drops on the trail. Would recommend good hiking boots to stay comfortable with the small muddy spots and ankle deep\u00a0water crossings over athletic shoes. Didn't need to use hiking poles, elevation changes where moderate at best, very comfortable without them.Overall, the trail was in good shape, the rushing waters over the large boulders in the river below the trail are lovely to hear and see during the whole hike. Definitely recommend as a nice shoulder season hike while waiting for the snow melt on higher elevation trails.", "date": "8 days ago"}, {"comment": "We wound up doing about 12 miles on this lovely river trail because there was no clear endpoint!

It was snow camping at Larch Lake and a bit windy but otherwise very pleasant. Some folks I saw had snow shoes which would have been nice exploring around Larch Lake. My shoes fell apart at the TH so I did it in Chacos with microspikes. Poles were nice to have.Chiwaukum Creek Trail: Burned area from TH to Jct with N. Fork Chiwaukum has ~40 recent blow-down. Much of this is due to trees still coming down from the fire a couple years ago. There are some decent logs across Chiwaukum Creek at about mile 5 where the bridge used to be and a new sign for the crossing.N. Fork Chiwaukum Trail: ~25 blow-down from the Jct with Chiwaukum Creek Trail to Glacier Creek Trail Jct. The trail was occasionally muddy and dusted with snow. Beyond Glacier Creek the trail crosses the N. fork of Chiwaukum Creek on a nice split log bridge and then climbs to Chiwaukum lake. The climb is steep and getting pretty overgrown. Some loppers would go a long way on this section. From Chiwaukum Lake to Larch Lake the trail is in good condition. Complete snow coverage began in earnest between Chiwaukum Lake and Larch Lake with about a foot of snow in places at Larch.The larches are in full swing and make a beautiful contrast with the snow. The burned area down low has plenty of fall color in the underbrush. Only saw a handful of folks up there on a blue sky Sunday.<3 the Chiwaukum", "date": "Oct 15, 2017"}, {"comment": "First, it's important to mention that in order to get to the trailhead (Summer Trail) that WTA suggests, you have to make a reservation in ADVANCE to get a shuttle from base camp (off Coulter Creek rd, next to the train tracks) to High Camp, where the trail starts. Otherwise, the dirt road from base to High Camp is private and blocked off to hikers.\u00a0My boyfriend and I tried to get to this trailhead but we were not able to get ahold of anyone at High Camp. After multiple calls and with no other public road to access Larch and Chiwaukum Lakes, we decided to start at the Chiwaukum trail head (7908) instead about 12 miles further east down the US 2 highway, therefore doubling our hike in from 6 miles to 12 miles. Elevation started at 2000ft and went up to 5200ft.The first half was fairly decent. Many of the trees were burnt from a past forest fire, causing there to be minimal shade, but after a few miles this gave way to forest. The trail was fairly maintained but poorly signed. Many times we had to stare at our map for a good five minutes to figure out which trail to take. You will eventually come across a sign saying \"Ford.\" Follow this trail and cross the river and in about .5 miles you'll find the T where you can turn left or right. Turning right follows the North Fork river. The elevation gain was slow but steady until reaching this crossing. \u00a0\u00a0The last 2 miles to Chiwaukum Lake, however, the trail was so overgrown that it was almost impossible to walk through the overgrown plants and brush that stood taller than our heads. Along with steep switchbacks and the early evening sun, this part of the hike was not enjoyable at all. We STRONGLY recommend hikers avoid this route until the over-grown brush is cleared. \u00a0\u00a0We arrived at Chiwaukum Lake after hiking for 10 hours, exhausted but happy. We camped there for two nights and day-hiked to Larch Lake (continuing on the Chiwaukum trail). This portion of the trail to Larch Lake was enjoyable and much more maintained, and the lake was beautiful. We had both lakes to ourselves and didn't encounter a single person during our two night stay. Bug's weren't terrible, but did become pesky at times.\u00a0On the hike out, we were determined to not have to bush-whack, so we used our map to instead hike to High Camp, hoping that we would then be able to catch a ride back down the dirt road and to our car at the Chiwaukum Trail head. For this, we followed the Mcue Ridge trail for about 2.2 miles, turned right onto Low Road trail, and then turned left onto Mac's Express trail. After a couple miles of steep elevation loss, we reached High Camp. We then had to walk down the 8.5 mile dirt road from High Camp back to the original trailhead where WTA suggested we start the hike, on Coulter Creek Road. From there, we were too exhausted to hike the last 12 miles to our car, so we hitchhiked back to the Chiwaukum Trail head.\u00a0Overall, the hike was more challenging than we expected and wanted, but the lakes were beautiful.\u00a0", "date": "Aug 26, 2017"}, {"comment": "Stayed at Scottish High Camp and struck out on a wet and chilly trip to Larch Lake, but trail is in good condition. Slightly too early for major larch color, but all the brush and trees are super colorful. Really pretty hike, only a couple down logs to hop over. Stream crossings are also easy, even after a day of fairly steady rain. \r Larch Lake is absolutely gorgeous; had the place to myself for an overnight. Careful where you put your tent, lots of restoration work happening. It snowed overnight and the morning was super gorgeous in the meadow.

The trail is in good condition, the stream crossing near the top has an easy ford just downstream, and snow doesn't start until above 5,000ft\u2014and even then it's just short patches. The switchbacks were nearly snow-free until you reach a solid snow field 6,200ft, which we followed straight up on our skis, leaving the trail which continues traversing to the left. We skied all the way over to Lake Edna (on what would be the Icicle Ridge trail) and camped.\r Wednesday we left at 7am and skied through the col North of the Lake (also would-be Icicle Ridge trail). We maintained our elevation, skiing over the upper reaches of Chiwaukum Creek trail and staying left of Lake Brigham and Lake Flora. (If you are climbing the Chiwaukum Creek trail to get to Brigham and Flora, patchy snow will start at 5,200ft, ~0.3 miles from the lakes, which lie at 5,700 ft and are mostly frozen over). We continued northward, traversing the southeastern flanks of Snowgrass Mountain to the stony ridge above Lake Charles.\r We packed our skis through an exposed scramble, after which we descended toward frozen Lake Charles, and then continued northward around Big Chiwaukum. We gained the ridge above Cup Lake, and left sudden white-out conditions for a fun descent with a few very minor wet-slides. We passed the lake and stayed left, and climbed back into the clouds via the snow on the far ridge. From there, we maintained elevation with excellent views of the Scottish High Lakes area\u2014Chiwaukum Lake, Loch Eileen, Lake Julius, Lake Ethel. Look at the picture of Cup and Larch Lake for an Idea of snow conditions. Lakes Ethel, Eileen, and Julius are 700-1,200ft lower than this, and from what I remember were pretty accesible with only patchy snow. We reached a steep slide path, referred to as The Swath, and followed the ridge left a couple hundred feet till we found a more appealing shoot. After a (horrendous, epic, painful) brush battle, we followed a deteriorating logging \"road\" back to our ride on White Pine Road.\r---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\rTo ask questions, just leave a comment below.

This loop is somewhere around 35 miles and hits the areas that I consider to be the Alpine Lakes Wilderness' finest.\r The burn area pretty much starts right from the TH and continues for about 5.5 miles towards Chiwaukum Lake.  There are 30-35 downed trees from the TH to the N F Chiwaukum Cr trail junction; most are a non-issue.  The trail has held up quite well in the burn area and there aren't too many tread issues.  The foot-logs over the first crossing of the Chiwaukum are charred, but still usable.\r From the N F Chiwaukum Cr trail junction to Chiwaukum Lake, there are ~ 15 downed trees; ~ 10 of these are in the final .1 miles of the burn area - most are straightforward enough.  Glacier Cr is currently a ford at the trail crossing, but there are logs 200' or so upstream.  The N F Chiwaukum crossing has logs to cross on.  As you start heading up the switchbacks towards Chiwaukum Lake, the route becomes ridiculously brushy.  Seriously, I thought I was back in MT on the PNT.  There are serious tread issues as well.\r From Chiwaukum Lake to Larch Lake, things are in pretty good shape.  ~ 15 downed trees, with the potential for 1-2 small fords.\r From where I picked up the Frosty-Wildhorse Trail to Frosty Pass (maybe a little over 3 miles from Frosty), things are good.  No snow and no trees down.  Plenty of creek crossings, with 1-2 that some may have to ford.  \r From Frosty Pass to Ladies Pass, things are in good shape.  Mostly snow-free, with a few snowy traverses that most will be Ok with.  \r If wanting to continue on towards Lake Edna, there are currently 2 steep snow traverses as you head up the shoulder of Cape Horn.  You can hike around them, but it will require some effort.  From Cape Horn's summit I could see there is still snow heading towards Chatter Cr, but it was hard to gauge how much.  Edna was 15-20% melted out, with snow-free camps visible.\r From Ladies Pass back to the N F Chiwaukum Cr trail junction things are interesting at times.  Look at the third photo below for snow status dropping down to Brigham and Flora Lakes.  A few patches remain below the lakes, but it was straightforward.  The creek crossing at ~ 4800' is currently a ford, but it's not difficult.  ~ 25 downed trees along this stretch, with most being a non-issue.  At times and for a lot of the way, it's an absolute brush-fest; seriously brutal.  You re-enter the burn .1 miles or so before the trail junction.\r -Cheers!", "date": "Jun 11, 2015"}],

I'd definitely recommend the Carne High Route as a top destination for larches (and stunning mountain views in the fall). The trail is dusty (at least it was before the rain/snow) and dry (no water) until you reach the first basin above the many switchbacks. Past Carne Mountain, the trail is relatively\u00a0easy to follow when it goes through the woods or meadows and harder to follow across rocky slopes and basins. There's plenty of water at stream crossings in several larch-filled basins as you head towards Mt Maude. There's a few steep slopes that you'll traverse but nothing that feels sketchy (especially without snow on the trail). When I got off trail (a few times), I found that, heading towards Mt. Maude, the trail trended upwards (sometimes steeply upwards) when it disappeared in the rocky basins. Look for cairns and faint trails over the rocks. After the highest saddle (looking down at Ice Lake) the trail trends downward (very steeply at first). Follow the cairns below the first saddle to traverse across a rocky slope (where there's a deep gully to cross). Another hiker used GAIA GPS on his phone and it showed him the trail. My Green Trail Map wasn't\u00a0as helpful to show the specific route.I camped for two nights in the larch-filled basins, once under starry skies and the next night with rain and snow. There were some beautiful camping spots along the trail (some that were/are obviously used by horses), with views out to Glacier peak, surrounding mountains and valleys below.\u00a0Spider meadow and the view from the glacier was gorgeous (even in the snow). It snowed/rained for two days. Most of the snow melted in the valley, while the glacier got up to 6 inches of fresh powder.The long dirt road to\u00a0the trailhead is rocky, pot holed and (especially from the last turnoff) extremely rutted for long stretches.

The hike, the meadow, Phelps Basin, and the trek up to the Spider Pass area are all spectacular. Despite being a holiday weekend, it was not very crowded, a nice temperature, minimal bugs. Overall, this is absolutely a must-do... if you have the right vehicle for it. I drive a low-clearance front-wheel drive compact car and generally push the limits on what people define as a \"rough\" road to a trailhead. This time, pushed the limits too far. There are both very rocky/bumpy spots as well as intermittent deep sand, and despite going slow and trying to be extra careful, we ended up getting stuck on the way down in the deep sand for about an hour until finally with enough digging, propping up of tires, and recruiting of kind souls from passing cars to push were we finally able to get out. It is true that this road is passable with a regular car (probably 10-20% of the vehicles at the trailhead are similar low-clearance front-wheel drive), but know that you will be pushing your luck no matter how carefully you try to take it -- it's a coin flip whether you'll get stuck at some point. I think with either high-clearance or four-wheel drive (if you've got both, you're great), you will not have palpitations the whole way up and down like we did. If you have no other option but a frontwheel drive, low-clearance car, there is some room for a handful of cars to park at the bottom of the ~2 mile road up to the trailhead.

And a great base from which to pop up to Spider Gap the next morning before heading back down through Spider Meadows and on to home.This would be a great hike for beginners, as the elevation gain is barely noticeable all the way to Spider Meadow. \u00a0The camps on the edge of the meadow at 5.2 miles are incredibly picturesque (better than the ones on the far side of the meadow,) and if you're willing to march on another couple miles and climb a bunch of switchbacks at the very end, the camps on the bluff are the ultimate overnight destination. The views of Spider Meadow and Phelps Basin from there are epic.\u00a0The road is even worse than I expected based on other trip reports. \u00a0I would definitely not attempt the last 2 miles without a high-clearance, preferably four-wheel-drive vehicle. \u00a0We made it in a VW Vanagon Camper w/2-wheel drive, but it made me pretty nervous due to the several sections of deep powdered dust which fill monstrous ruts. If we had stopped in one of those dust holes, I'm certain we'd have gotten stuck. There are ruts that are far deeper than a lot of car's clearances much of the way, and there are some big rocks to contend with too, and the dust pits. \u00a0The 12-ish miles prior to that aren't too bad at all though.Bugs were close to non-existent in the bluff camp, but there were some mosquitoes and biting flies down in the meadow.Overall this was a wonderful destination, well worth the long drive. \u00a0", "date": "Aug 28, 2017"}],

There are several downed trees blocking road as the snow begins. Total of 8-10 trees down from gate to TH.I set up camp at the TH Thursday night and left my tent up while I ventured up for the day.

The gate is still closed and likely will be until May. Snow starts at about 1.5 miles up the road. We ended up putting snowshoes on as the snow was soft from the sun and we were postholing quite a bit. We arrived at the trailhead at 2 pm and took a short break before heading up the trail. We were glad we had snowshoes but microspikes or crampons would be fine as long as you start early before the snow softens. It took us about 3.5 hours to get from the trailhead the lake with 60 lb packs on. It's worth noting that at about 5000 feet, the boot path leaves the trail and goes straight up the mountain instead of switchbacking. The boot path is well defined and easy to follow all the way to the lake. When we arrived at the lake, a guy notified us that someone was walking on the lake earlier and had postholed through (although he was wearing a pack and did not have snowshoes on). Luckily, he had a change of clothes and was ok. We skirted the frozen lake shore and set up camp on land. I decided to dig down to see what the lake conditions were like. There was about 1.5 to 2 feet of consolidated snow sitting followed by 8 inches of standing water and a layer of ice. Although this was pretty sketchy, it made for easy water access! It would be wise to avoid walking on the lake during the day time but it was plenty cold for it to freeze over at night. I was able to test out my hammock and slept surprisingly well until bad weather rolled in early at 6 am. I moved to the tent and we slept in until about 9 am. We made breakfast and were packed and ready to go by noon. Microspikes were sufficient for the descent to the trailhead this time.

Beautiful day!", "date": "Oct 30, 2017"}, {"comment": "Summary:Last week when I tried to\u00a0hike Lake Ingalls I couldnt reach\u00a0the split to Longs pass due to increasing amount of snow being dumped and nothing being visible after a point. I decided unless someone puts up a report I\u00a0would\u00a0not attempt Ingalls again I kept on waiting for reports from Saturday but none posted till Sunday morning. It has been a sunny week and I heard yesterday someone at Bellevue P&R that they were going to Ingalls so I couldnt resist and decide to go anyway.There was no snow on road till trailhead. The washouts are there on last mile of road but easily passable. The last washout may be more tricky and would not recommend in low clearance vehicle (there were multiple sedans parked just before this washout). Still it was much smaller distance to trailhead from where I had to park last Sunday. Reached trailhead around 11am and there were around 20+ vehicles parked at trailhead. The scene was completely different from last weekend. Hard to imagine that it was the same place. There are small patches of snow till Ingalls pass but I didnt need crampons till I crossed the pass. There was much more snow on north side of pass, you have to be careful about where you are stepping. Sometimes the trail in basin and towards the lake Ingalls disappears but if you look around you can figure it out.Special thanks to all the people who put up the cairns on the trail to signal trail. It was really helpful and saved me a lot of time both while going up and down to/from lake. Most of the people seemed to be returning without doing Lake as they didnt have traction or it was getting later in the day and snow was slowing them down. However a couple encouraged me that trip to lake was worth it and it was. It is pretty\u00a0uphill just before you reach lake and cairns helped a lot here in signaling where to go, this part was mostly snow free though.Had lunch at a rock at the lake with beautiful views of Mt Stuart and others. No wind, very calm and warm weather and as someone mentioned on the trail \"Tshirt weather\". Took bunch of photos and then started heading back. The sun went behind the mountain and no sunlight in basin area around 3:30 or 3:45. Once I crossed the Ingalls pass around 4pm I removed crampons and headed down. It was much more windy at pass as compared to weather so far and wind kept on getting stronger while I came down. Around 4:30pm the sun was about to go below ridge on the south side of the pass so I took a break to let it soak in got my headlamp ready at easy access and put on another layer. I kept on getting windier and colder. Reached trailhead by 5.30pm and there were 3 other vehicles left other than mine. Probably because I started late in the day and I saw only 1 group going up while I was coming down. Back in the car and back to Seattle by 7:45pm. The sun was still setting while I was about to reach Cle Elum. Such a beautiful day. Will come again here next year. May be I will see goats then. I could not spot any goats today. I also asked others on the trail but no one spot any spots on the weekend.There was a cap and a blue stick/hiking pole put above the Esmeralda trailhead sign if in case someone lost theirs", "date": "Oct 29, 2017"}, {"comment": "We'd been trying to get up to Lake Ingalls for months and finally had the opportunity this weekend. Despite the only recent reports saying the road to the trailhead being bad and the trail itself being covered in snow we went for it anyways. The road did have some washout but it wasn't a problem in our Tundra. We must have hit the perfect timing between old melted snow and new. The first 3 miles(guesstimate) were nearly snow free and the trail was in great condition. When we reached the\u00a0pass the snow was heavy enough that we all put on spikes. Which I would definitely recommend. From there on out you would need them most the way. The larches are pretty much done for the season but it was still beautiful.

The smaller washout you can still try to manage with high clearance vehicle but the last washout is impassable with car. I saw only 4 cars other than mine parked there. All of them parked before the 1st washout except a Subaru which was parked before the last washout\u00a0which was impassable. I took more than 15 minutes to back up, turn and park along road.Walked 0.7 miles from where I parked along the road while it rained. There was no one at trailhead and it started snowing. After 1 mile past the split between\u00a0Esmeralda and Ingalls the winds picked up speed and also started snowing hard. Couldnt reach\u00a0split point of Longs pass as well and decided to head back since I was alone and didnt want to risk facing even stronger winds as visibility was very poor. At trailhead met a couple who had parked their Subaru before the impassble washout. They told that one of them stomped on snow or clear the way for car and gave direction while other drove. So I would not recommend trying to cross the smaller washouts if you are alone. Unless you have a strong pickup truck. After reaching back at car it was just short of\u00a0half mile on my mobile app and it was raining rather than snowing there.\u00a0While driving back Cle Elum was sunny but the weather up north still looked dark and cloudy.

Near the beginning, at a fork where you decide if you want to head to \"Sauer's Mountain (2 mi)\" or \"Viewpoint (0.2 mi),\" we decided to head up to the viewpoint. We\u00a0discovered afterward that both these paths converge later, so it doesn't matter\u00a0which way you choose to go, but if you go left to the viewpoint, you get amazing views of the snow-capped mountains.\u00a0Wildflowers are starting to bloom and it's extremely pretty. We passed a few groups on the way up, but it was overall really quiet. Views of the surrounding mountains pop up all along the trail, since there aren't many trees blocking your view. The majority of the hike is quite low-grade steepness, but the very last part is steep again.\u00a0The last scramble was worth it though; the views of surrounding peaks and Leavenworth from the summit were incredible. I don't really know how I had not heard of Sauer's Mountain until very recently, but the weather happened to be perfect, and the trail itself is incredibly interesting and fun because the views are so prominent.\u00a0We stayed at the top for almost 2 hours enjoying the views, most of the time relatively alone. On the way down, we saw a couple people going up, but not many.

He told us of a dog growling at his when they started the trailhead.\u00a0We had not expected this hike to be such a climb. Hiking poles would be an excellent idea. A few parts of the trail are steep and sandy so footing isn't the easiest. Pack in your water, you will want it. In the hot summer months, starting early would be good as there are many sections of the trail without any covering. Once you get to the top the views are great.

The first time I put it into the GPS and I drove there. Only thing was that it took me to some old and closed logging road so I had to dig to find this trail head. I used this site and Gold Creek to park. There is the first problem, there are two mountains, Green and Gold and yet this takes you to Green. Just odd naming to me. Then while all the trails have signs as you hike, there isn't any saying Green Mountain or summit with an arrow. Just felt so lost, glad I had my phone so I could just know what direction I had to go. I finally went off trail and just went straight up for awhile to shave off some time and keep my sanity. Not bad, just needs much better signs. First time I missed the trail up. You need to go left after the first bridge and before the second.

Then this is probably not where you want to spend your day. However, if you\u2019re looking for a deep forest path to navigate while you sort through your thoughts, while thinking about nothing at all, then let this trail be your guide.My dog and I started at the lower trailhead. We arrived at about 10:30 am on a Saturday, and we were the only vehicle there. Note: there are some pretty impressive pot holes on the narrow drive in. The first 2 miles are nothing but up. It\u2019s a great warm up! Be prepared to want to shed layers. Maybe spray some anti fog on your glasses if you depend on the spectacles.After you reach about two miles into the trail, you\u2019ll cross a service road before getting back on the trail. At this point, you get a little bit of a breather because you\u2018re greeted with a small downhill portion. I also saw bits of snow in patches off the trail, which I thought was kind of neat. There\u2019s a portion of the trail here which is kind of gravely, so you may want to watch your footing a bit.You'll come to another road pretty quickly, and in order to get back on the trail, you have to walk a little ways down the road to your right. There\u2019s also a little parking area here and there were three cars parked here, so maybe more people like to park there.\u00a0Once you get back on the trail, the scenery starts to improve substantially. You get a river and fallen trees that have been artfully created into bridges. It\u2019s like a confidence course when crossing with a dog. \u201cDo you trust me, mom? \u00a0That I won\u2019t send us flying off the bridge into the river below? Do you? Do you?\u201d A hike isn\u2019t a hike without a bit of adrenaline thrown in for good measure.\u00a0We eventually reached the Big Quilcene trailhead, which is where we turned around and went back the way we came. I do want to hike that trail eventually, but an 8.6 mi round trip hike was enough for one day.\u00a0Also, side note: Going DOWN the final 2mi/2,000 ft descent presents it\u2019s own set of uniques challenges. I slipped and fell once like the clumsy old lady that I\u2019m not. Clumsy? Yes. Old? Negative. Make sure your shoes have a decent enough tread to catch you before you fall. Also, your legs will feel it. Maybe. I don\u2019t know you, the person reading this trip report, but I\u2019m just saying your legs may feel that descent.The trail is in good condition overall.

"comments":[{"comment": "We scouted out this fun little wilderness enclave on our drive to the Wallowa Mountains. South of Walla Walla on state highway is this little pocket wilderness area. It is seemed so small and hemmed in by roads that it had us talking all evening about how big a wilderness area must be, the politics of land preservation, and all that stuff. \r We drove 2.5 miles from the highway to a dry, highish elevation trailhead. The hike began as an old abandoned logging road along the edge of the North Fork of the Umatilla River. It appears that most users now are horse folks, although the trail was not heavily used by any stretch. The first mile shares tread with the Lick Canyon Trail which eventually turns south and downward into the valley loosing several thousand feet in the process. \r We headed past that turn off with our sights set on Grouse Mountain. Funny thing was that Grouse Mountain was actually lower than the ridge line and the parking lot. The walking was easy although the trail is thin in places. Lots of basalt, dried grasses, and the sweet smell of summertime pines. \r Out and back could take all day or it could be an hour to stretch the legs as it was for us. Our favorite memory of the trip was the hand carved water trough at Zig-Zag Spring.", "date": "Aug 29, 2014"}],

There is minimal parking and no real indication the trail is there except for the Heritage Marker on the side of the road. Once you find the Heritage Marker, you can't miss the trail.\u00a0The trail has loose rock and gravel so can be slippery at times. It leads you right up the crevise between the 2 \"sister\" pillars which affords fantastic views. One pillar has a cable to hold on to for circumnavigating. The other does not but it is possible to fully go around each pillar.\u00a0From beyond the rocks, it is possible to explore the open land behind the trail to possibly make this a little longer outing as this is not really a \"hiking trail\" so much as a road side attraction.\u00a0", "date": "11 days ago"}, {"comment": "The trailhead lies just off the freeway marked by a large sign telling the legend of the Twin Sisters rocks. This is less of a hike, and more of a short exploration of a some gorgeous scenery overlooking a river gorge. As you start on the trail you're greeted on your left by the Twin Sisters rocks overlooking you, with a steep rocky wall forming your left handrail. To your right a rock wall rises into a jagged gravel peninsula overlooking the parking area. When you round the hill the scene unfolds until a hilly field that reminded me of a very Lord of the Rings feel, there were even a couple shacks off in the distance.\u00a0The actual trail leading up to the Twin Sisters rocks is steep, but very short making for an easy ascent. The ground is loose though, and the area is exposed and open to fast winds. I actually slipped as I was coming down, and earned a minor scrape on my forearm.\u00a0We had a great time walking around snapping photos, there was no physical challenge or time commitment in getting to the views, allowing us to focus on taking good photos of the scenery. We had hoped for more wildflowers, but the ones we found were exceedingly beautiful. The wind was pretty crazy, and a lot of the trail was formed by loose rocks and gravel, but nothing was particularly difficult to traverse.

We still got a little sprinkled on, but it was a nice walk in the woods.We parked at the High Point Trailhead, lots of empty spots around 1:30p. We took the Around the Lake Trail to the Nook Trail. The Nook Trail is very vibrant right now--lots of running water and bright green moss everywhere. We took a left onto the Talus Rocks Trail. The water is running pretty high from recent weather but we navigated the waterfall crossing fairly easily, though we did walk a bit down instead of trying to walk precariously on the wet logs. There was one other semi-tricky water crossing that we went up and around to avoid stepping on slick, submerged rocks.We then headed back down on the T3 trail back close to where we started and then continued on again on the Around the Lake Trail to add a bit more length and time ro our hike. This very section is flat. We followed it to the right after the bus and then continued on to connect up with what I think is the swamp trail?... runs to the north of the lake and then back to the parking lot!

You could skirt the edge of the trail in most cases to avoid the deepest water.\u00a0 WT3 is pretty steep in most places, and there were a lot of areas (especially after it crosses the Cable Line Trail) where it was like a river right on the trail.Maps are important - I'm directionally challenged, and I'm used to trails with either great signs everywhere, or only one trail.\u00a0 So I knew I had to bring my \"A game\" for this one.\u00a0 Instead, I think I showed up with my \"C- game\" (still passing, but maybe I should've studied more).What I planned to do: Puget Power Trail -> Tradition Lake Loop/Around The Lake Trail -> Bus Trail -> West Tiger #3 Trail; Total should\u2019ve been 6.5mi.What I ACTUALLY did: Puget Power Trail -> Wetlands Trail -> took left fork back to Puget Power Trail -> Turned around took the other fork & continued on Wetlands Trail -> Bonneville Power Trail -> Puget Power Trail -> Tradition Lake Loop/Around The Lake Trail -> Bus Trail -> West Tiger #3 Trail.\u00a0 Total 9mi.Looked @ Green Trails map at a kiosk at the intersection of the Wetlands & Bonneville Power Trails, but there was a HORRIBLY placed \"You Are Here\" arrow on the map that actually got in the way of the trail, so I couldn\u2019t see that the Bus Trail was just a little S of this location, so that\u2019s why I went back N. :(#ProTip There are a lot of side trails/forks.\u00a0 Unless you know exactly where you are going, you should bring a map or cell phone with a trail map app.(Yeah, that\u2019s one of the ten essentials.\u00a0 I\u2019d done my research with WTA/AllTrails maps before the hike, and had a general understanding of where I was going.\u00a0 So I wasn\u2019t TOO concerned about taking wrong turns.\u00a0 It was just going to mean a longer hike. I was comfortable with the extra distance, but if the weather was better I definitely would've consulted a map on my phone.Around The Lake Trail \u2013 It was really rainy/windy, so I was mostly trying to keep my head down.\u00a0 That\u2019s how I missed the entrance to this one, which caused all of my other directional problems.\u00a0 There\u2019s no sign on the main trail.\u00a0 But if you look to the left side of the trail, you can see the entrance fence + sign from Puget Power Trail.\u00a0 Note: If you get to the Bonneville Power Trail, you\u2019ve gone too far!Rain Newb - Today was my first ever hike in the rain.\u00a0 I figured I could use the experience of dealing with the bad weather, but in hindsight maybe I should\u2019ve started with a shorter hike to identify some critical gear deficiencies.\u00a0 Overall, I\u2019ve never been so wet from head to toe.\u00a0Gloves - I realized about 1mi into it that my gloves were apparently neither waterproof NOR water resistant.\u00a0 So I basically wore sponges on my hand for the entire hike.\u00a0 Thankfully, my hands still stayed warm enough for the hike.\u00a0 Had a thicker pair of gloves with me, but they were fleece & would\u2019ve been worse.\u00a0Shell \u2013 Got completely soaked through.\u00a0 It was a cheap, old Columbia jacket that I thought was waterproof but never used it for continuous time in the rain like this.\u00a0 Once that soaks through, it\u2019s game over & now everything else was wet. Definitely did not help that I left 1-2 pockets open at various points.\u00a0 Oops.Boots/Socks \u2013 Knew that foot care is critical, especially for long hikes.\u00a0 And I thought the boots were waterproof (definitely Gore Tex).\u00a0 But I have my doubts after today\u2019s experience.\u00a0 Had on rain pants, and those & my hiking pants covered the tops of the boots.\u00a0 But my socks were soaked, and I ended up pouring about a quarter cup of water out of one of the boots when I got home.\u00a0 Hope they\u2019ll be dry again by summer.\u00a0 Could be that these got soaked because water got through the shell, and compromised all of my other layers.If you have any advice for avoiding any of these problems for me or other hikers that will hopefully read this, please share below!", "date": "Apr 8, 2018"}, {"comment": "Short of time, I opted for a couple of flat miles in the Tiger Mountain area.

The rocks looked so pretty with a dusting! Once we started to descend to the waterfall section, I decided to through on my spikes just to be extra safe. My husband didn't use his and was fine, though he was cautious. The waterfall is not running to swiftly but enough to look pretty.

About a mile after the junction, we put on microspikes.The last mile and a half or so is entirely snow-covered, but hard-packed with a clear trail. Spikes and/or poles definitely recommended if you're heading up all the way to the lakes. There are holes where previous hikers look like they'd postholed knee deep, but unless we get a fresh dump of snow, the trail wants spikes more than it wants snowshoes.\u00a0The snow bridges over the small creeks on top of the ridge have melted, so the last half-mile is a bitof slippery scrambling up and down snow banks.Near the end of the trail, the trail gets a bit lost. Take the first right after the junction with Thompson to get to the smaller lake. We didn't follow the left fork, but that probably leads to the larger one.The lake is still mostly frozen over, and beautifully isolated even on a clear Sunday morning.

The roads to the high trail-heads are still snow covered which made for a bit of road walking from Godman Camp.Road conditions:Skyline road: Snow free from the North to within a couple hundred yards of Godman camp. Patchy snow from Godman to NF-300 intersection. Friday I high-centered myself trying to take the road around Bluewood ski area but with adventurous memorial day weekend traffic it may now be passable.NF-4608 (to Teepee TH):\u00a0~1-3 feet deep continuous snow from the Skyline road to Teepee TH.NF-300 (to Twin Buttes/Slick ear TH): ~1-3 feet deep mostly continuous snow for about a mile from the Skyline road. Upper portion of road near TH is melted out.Trail conditions (There are two Grizzly Bear Ridge trails in the Tucannon-Wenaha called by different names ... confusing ... I use the NF trail #'s below):Mt. Misery trail: Mostly covered in 0-3' deep snow from Teepee TH to Oregon Butte.Grizzly Bear Ridge (#3121): A primitive ridge line route from Oregon Butte to Crooked Creek. There is no sign for this trail Jct at either end and I saw only\u00a0a few\u00a0patches of tread.Crooked Creek trail: I met Crooked Creek Trail at 3600' after heading downhill from a saddle on Grizzly Bear Ridge. From this point the trail is somewhat overgrown and brushy to where it crosses Crooked Creek at about 3200'. From here the trail is sparse and badly overgrown for about a mile. It gets better as it climbs the hillside but has plenty of downed trees to hop over. The trail crosses the creek\u00a0twice then Melton Creek. All knee deep fords.\u00a0Trail is well maintained from Melton Creek to the Wenaha River.Wenaha River trail: From Crooked Creek to Butte Creek the trail is over grown but easy to follow through burned terrain. Crooked Creek can be crossed on logs. From Butte Creek to the Jct with Grizzly Bear Ridge trail (#3103) the trail is faint, brushy, and disappears at times. You leave the burn and enter lovely\u00a0forest about a mile west of Butte Creek (which was a mid-thigh ford). From Grizzly Bear Ridge trail (#3103)\u00a0Jct to Slick Ear Jct the tread is good and easy to follow with only a few downed trees. Rock Creek at the Grizzly Bear Ridge Jct was a knee deep ford. I met a lot of rattlesnakes along the Wenaha and accidentally stepped on one in an overgrown part of the trail.\u00a0Both parties were surprised and alarmed.Slick ear trail: Upper portion is in good condition. Through the forest there are frequent small blowdown. Near the Jct with the Wenaha River Trail there is a large difficult section of blow-down that you have to work around for about 100 yards. The trail fords Slick Ear Creek six times, all were wet feet today.Grizzly Bear Ridge trail (#3103): Up high the trail follows an old road bed that is well maintained. The road ends in meadows at which point you follow trail that becomes faint but followable as you move in and out of burned forest. The trail then drops to the Wenaha River on well graded switchbacks that were overgrown along Rock Creek.", "date": "May 29, 2017"}],

I do agree with other hikers that this hike would be best in spring to see all the creeks and waterfalls, however there was still a lot to see. Just means we will have to plan another trip in the spring. There is no signing for day use parking, we parked right by the ranger station and a ranger told us that was good. He also told us the salmon were spawning in the river and told us where to go if we were interested. Pretty cool to watch. Used the bathrooms in the campground area which were nice and clean. Also used the vault toilet in the meadow campground area and it was probably the nicest smelling vault toilet I've ever been in. Bugs weren't bad at all on the trail.

From there I hiked through a luscious forest up a bit of a steep hill. Then I went through a flat area that had a lot of bugs near the end of the Maple Valley Trail.When you hit the fire road you have the option to go left back towards the entrance of the park, right, which I believe takes you further down the fire road to the top of the hill and forward, which begins the Steam Donkey Trail. (I later found out from Ranger Dippery that it was named Steam Donkey for the steam powered winches or logging engines that were used throughout the area to help with logging operations)\u00a0Steam Donkey Trail starts out relatively flat and also has bugs during August, so be sure to bring repellent! It eventually gets less bushy and becomes more open with trees. The trail starts to wind down hill and you pass by what used to be a pond or maybe is a pond when the season is right. The trail curves around and hits the fire road again. You can turn left and go up a short distance to hit the railroad grade trail or just turn right and head back towards the entrance. It was about 5 miles round trip.

Started at the Upper parking lot and started our hike up the Lilly Lake Trail, then for a steeper shorter trail we hiked up Max's Shortcut normally not to bad of a trail but when you are\u00a0carry a heavy pack on your back\u00a0you start looking differently at these trails, that would usually be a little calf burn turn in to a real good work out. We continued up in the warm sunny day not yet use to either the sun or warmth since rainy and snowy hikes have been the norm in recant days in the foot hills here. Got to the end of\u00a0Mad Max's Shortcut and turned right to Lilly lake headed up to the hiker's camp sites and set up camp, had some grub and chilled for a while then headed up to the Oyster Dome to catch the sunset, with small groups also joining coming and going with the sun going down quickly the hikers soon were thinning out except for just a few watching. The darkness soon took over the sky, the lights in the far distance from Anacortes and the\u00a0Refinery shimmered and looked very much like Christmas lights. After a bit headed back down\u00a0Beyond The Oyster Dome\u00a0Trail to Lily Lake, on our way we heard a very\u00a0close and loud owl letting its self be known of its presence maybe it didn't care for\u00a0our headlamps. Back at Lilly Lake camp had an awesome fire AKA \"camp TV\" with hundreds of frogs singing\u00a0 into the night. The moon was shinning through the trees lighting up small areas on the forest floor adding to the abeyance of our pleasant evening. In the afternoon when we packed up we hiked out on the Lily Lizard connector trail with the frogs still\u00a0serenading us down the trail. Headed up\u00a0North Butte for a gander then continued back down towards Lizard Lake. Took a little lunch break at Lizard and enjoyed the scenery,\u00a0also checking out the busy beavers handy\u00a0work on the trees around the lake. Filled up on some fresh\u00a0water coming down the small waterfall next to Lizard Lake\u00a0on the\u00a0British Army Trail. Left Lizard and headed to the Alternate Incline Trail, this trail has had a lot of fresh love given to it recently, improving\u00a0trail drainage and bringing the trail bed up to keep it out of the muck, while still leaving the old logging remnants where they had been left rusting away so many decades ago, I still enjoy seeing these trail markers in this area makes you appreciate the second growth we get to use that much more. After Alternate Incline at the end taking a right turn on BL-ML road took us back to the Upper parking lot ready to toss those packs off and having a seat felt pretty good. I love this area and will be doing more camping here again soon I hope.", "date": "7 days ago"}, {"comment": "I\u2019ve done this trail a few times now and it never fails to deliver.

I began by going up the Summit Loop, gaining several hundred feet in the first mile. At the Summit is a small water tank. A little south of that is a winding switchback clearly made for mountain bikes. At the top of these switchbacks is probably the best view in the Uplands, a sweeping panorama of the south most Selkirks, with Mica Peak towering to the East. There are a few options at this point. Follow the pole line to bypass the switchbacks or use them to savor the view. Once you descend you can use the Short Draw trail to shave some time off your return to the trailhead, or you can follow the Uplands loop. I opted for the latter. In the lowland, things are rough.

The views into the White Salmon River canyon were impressive. Cross several creeks, such as Morrison, Buck, and Wicky. Most of the latter hike can be quite dry, save for the bridged Morrison Creek crossing. The old growth forest is quite beautiful\u2013especially in fall, when the quaking aspens turn bright yellow and the vine maples turn a fiery orange and red. The latter half of the loop also travels through selective cutting (logging) zones, so the forest is more open here. (This is also the main reason why the vine maples here turn bright red; as in the shade, vine maple turns a dull yellow).Note that the only \"view\" that you will get is of the White River canyon, near the start of the hike. The rest of the hike works its way through gently sloping, forested terrain.\u00a0There are several spots along the loop that might get confusing. The trail crosses various paved and gravel roads throughout the hike, yet it never feels all that \"developed.\" Most roads are lightly traveled, aside from Forest Roads 80 and 8040.\u00a0At some road crossings, users have painted white arrows on the pavement to help you re-join the trail. I would strongly advise following a GPS track for your convenience, although it is not necessary to do so.I would recommend this hike on an early spring or fall day, if and only if the higher trails on the mountain are still snowed in. Otherwise, many other trails on Mount Adams that reach treeline would be a better choice for someone's first Mount Adams hike.

Such a great forest walk with tall trees all around that is so easily accessible. There was plenty of parking at 9am on a rainy Saturday morning as well.My only caution is that the trails aren't marked that clearly, especially if you head in the wrong direction like we did.

Bridle Trails is near enough that if you live in Seattle it won't take up a full day to go for a walk there which is what appealed to us.In terms of parks, I'd say this one is a little bit uninspiring. There's not much here to make it stand out from other places. It's most unique feature is that it is more or less designed for equestrian use, so you'll definitely see some horses on your hike. There was also quite a few birds too.The park is a large squared plot of dense forest that is surrounded on all sides by roads and houses. There's a little noise from the nearby Interstate and the ever present plane noise. The park itself was quiet though, even on a nice day.Throughout the forest are numerous trails which can become\u00a0a bit confusing. I suggest picking up a map on your way in, although you may still find yourself getting lost. That's not much of a worry though since the park is small.The trails were a little muddy and covered in horse poop! But the grade of the trails isn't too bad and it made a nice day out for a walk.\u00a0", "date": "Mar 11, 2018"}, {"comment": "Put together a 4-mile loop run Sunday afternoon. First time here, and enjoyed it more than I expected. I got a little bit of rain and sun and mist. The trails were  damp, but not too muddy, and in great shape. It smelled so lovely of pine and soil (with a bit of occasdional farm flavor from the horse friends). Not crowded at all, and about an equal mix of equestrians, runners and hikers. Leash laws are strictly enforced, and all the pups were on best behavior. I did not listen to the wise advice in the hiking guide about hiking clockwise, so I got a little lost and found on my intended loop, but had fun rolling with it. It's so close to the 520 bridge and looked like it had good bike lanes on the Kirkland side ... I could see it being a fun   bike-to-hike adventure from Seattle.", "date": "Feb 25, 2018"}],

"comments":[{"comment": "We were looking for a short kid-friendly hike near Alderbrook resort. We found the parking lot easily enough, it was graveled and had a porta-potty. We might have known the trail would be confusing since it gave 2 start paths but we figured there would be markers along the way. The bridge pictured was cool, and we bobbled along. The first Y in the road wasn't marked. We guessed. The next wasn't either. We planned to do the upper loop. It was a steeper incline than my children would have liked, not super steep, but not a flat walk either. We never found a path marker until some time later, and wound our way around through clear cut. Not much to see really. Not sure if it was the rainy day, the confusion over the trail, or the hodge podge of bi-directional arrows along the way (<<-upper trail->>) while along the trail, but not at intersections, but we quite disliked this hike.Looked like they are working on a frisbee golf, which added in maybe some white arrows also? We could hear the road, made our way back to the stream, and found our way back to the car on various paths, not with any help from the trail markers. I don't think I'd recommend this hike. Maybe staying on the lower loop - it was much prettier, old growth, stream, moss...but very short, and we never did see trail markers for that or find that trail (I don't think)? It would be good for trail running if you knew where to go. The trail itself was clear.\u00a0We did find a trail map hidden behind a hinged flap piece of wood on the start path we didn't choose - once we returned. I think maybe because it was so rainy the words weren't obvious. Though I'm not sure this map would have helped. And ironically, this beautiful trail guide (upper and lower color coded) is only at the start, not along the way.\u00a0\u00a0", "date": "Apr 4, 2018"}, {"comment": "Great spot to hike with kids and dogs.

I marked 'obstacles on trail' because it's a quite a bit overgrown. Just thought it was worth noting that even a fairly thin person will be brushed by leaves, ferns, stickers, branches almost the entire hike. As will your kiddo's legs if you're wearing them on your back. Other than that we loved the hike! It was gorgeous and there's lots to look at.\u00a0", "date": "May 27, 2017"}, {"comment": "This trail is an absolute gem! Pulling into the parking lot you can really be fooled since it doesn't seem like the trashcans near the picnic table have been emptied for quite awhile (of course people have just left their trash either on top or next to it so they are more than overflowing) & this little jaunt is also home to a disc golf course... Thankfully, there wasn't anyone in the little unpaved 4-6 car lot so we had the entire place to ourselves. All of the snow has melted, both on the trail & on 119. The upper loop trail - 1.5mi, some of which is part of the disc golf course, is logged & nearly clearcut. We did the lower loop so can't speak on much more than that for the upper. The lower loop trail - 0.5mi is the old growth portion (at least what's left) with Dow creek intertwined & it follows around the edge of the forest. Visiting today after the big rain/wind storm yesterday we figured there might be some blowdowns, mud, & washouts. There was, but nothing impassable without good waterproof hiking boots & careful footing. Definitely recommend taking the lower loop counter-clockwise, starting to the right from the lot which descends a little & then comes abruptly to your first wooden bridge crossing Dow Creek. The trail forks after the bridge & veers off to the left going along the creek, then meanders to the right where there is a small stream crossing (overflowing today) that was also the source of some of the water coming down the trail like a little waterfall, washing it out a little bit. Nothing major there, but coming into the last bit of the trail just before the second wooden bridge crossing Dow Creek again, it was totally flooded with some super muddy spots. However, taking slow deliberate steps we were still able to close the loop; both half going around the worst/deepest looking parts of it as well as doing a bit of exploring in the little forest along the way. The only tree that was down completely over the trail was a smaller one & it wasn't difficult to pass at all. Everything else across the trail was stray bent branches or fallen limbs from the storm. Since there is also quite a few trails leading off from these 2 loops along the way, there's a couple of signs beyond the parking lot pointing you in the right direction. Saw a few mosquitoes, but not enough to bother with bug spray or anything like that. All in all a very enjoyable little walk with the season beginning to change, especially listening to the creek raging the entire way.", "date": "Feb 16, 2017"}, {"comment": "Did the lower loop.

"comments":[{"comment": "With the weather being very crummy and rainy in Western Washington, we hastily threw together a last minute hike east of the mountains to soak up some sun. The most recent trip report for this hike was somewhat misleading and or inaccurate for this page's trail description as we experienced much different conditions then that of the previous hiker. From the sounds of it, the other hiker may have approached the ridge from the North while we approached the trailhead directly from the southead and the official Iron Bear Trailhead itself.A friend and I arrived at the beginning of NF-9714 right off Highway 97 and immediately encountered 1-2 feet of snow not more than 150 yards from the highway. If your plans are to progress any further beyond this point, you will either have to snowshoe up to the trail head like we did, or get a high clearance vehicle with snow chains/tires to get any further. From where the snow begins, it was about a 1.5-2 hour snowshoe (3 miles or so I believe?) to get to just the Iron Bear Trailhead. The trailhead and parking lot itself still has about 2-3 feet snow on top of it if that gives you any inclination as to when it may be derivable in early summer. With the sun rapidly setting and our desire to spend a night outdoors, we set up camp about a mile in on the trail up on a snowless crest of a small ridge. It was a clear night out with temps dropping somewhere to 20 or 30 degrees, making 4 season sleeping bags very useful.\u00a0We woke up at 630 and got hiking up towards the top by 7 AM. We tried to get up as early as possible as the snowshoeing coming in on the trail the day before was very frustrating as you would get about 100 feet of good compacted snow, followed by 200 feet of more sun exposed and melted snow. Post holing and sliding was a big issue even with our MSR Snowshoes, making for a lot of cussing and nagging about the conditions... Getting up early helped us avoid these conditions towards the top but only really helped until we reached the second ridge from the top at 9 AM when we realized if we went any further, the sun would make the snow too unstable and cumbersome to deal with hiking all the way out. So we settled on not making it all the way up and headed out early instead, leaving in our car by about 2:30 or so.\u00a0Route finding was very difficult on this trail as snow still very much dominates the entire upper elevation areas of the cascades. We were barely able to follow the faint boot tracks of another hiker's previous summit making for a very time consuming route finding process the whole way up.In general, I would probably wait for this trail to melt out a little more if not completely before heading up as it may just make for an annoying hike, similar to what we experienced. Our Yak Traks were helpful when snowshoes were too clunky and big, but then again if the sun comes out then you will probably just be battling the snow for traction no matter what.Hopefully I covered enough info for this hike, if not feel free to ask a question and I might be able to help.", "date": "Mar 27, 2018"}, {"comment": "This splendid 10 mile loop adventure delivers in exercise, views, and solitude. I made the loop from road 9714 (off Blewett Pass Rd, the access to Iron Bear trail) to 113 to 200 and down 9715 ( Old Blewett Rd). The start, 9714, is 20 miles from downtown Cle Elum on Hwy 97. It is on the left, so be careful when turning off of the speedy highway. \u00a0 I saw no other people on the whole 4 hours I was out there. \u00a0The first two miles are fairly flat and the surface is rough. \u00a0Things improve when you start climbing on 113 and views start opening up. \u00a0After 1.5-2 miles on #113, you get to tour east on 200 along a beautiful ridge with nice views south.

In just a mile or so, you get to Old Blewett Rd, which is paved and has been snowmobiled and walked on. Parts of this road have melted out, esp on the lower sections.

The TH is inaccessible to cars for now.With the snowmelt we have had in Glacier over the last 2 weeks, I wanted to check out the road to Church Mountain TH. As both the road & trail are south facing, it is a good early season hike, at least the first parts.I drove maybe 1/3rd mile up the road, over some easily passable snow patches, when I met another car (van-like) - he had turned around just a few hundred yards up, so I decided to turn around and park there (it was snow free and wide enough to turn & park).Up a few hundred yards, where the power lines continue parallel to 542 but the road turns left, you could see that this is where earlier cars had turned. The snow was maybe 4-6 inches deep, but it was soft and I think my Subaru Outback with winter tires would have been fine. There was continued snow for a few hundred more yards, then it cleared but shortly after that a fallen tree is blocking the road so it was just as well I stopped where I did. It was easy to pass on foot, and as I got further up the road, there was fewer and fewer snow patches with less snow - clearly the sun hitting the road compared to the lower sections being more in the shade. There is one more tree across the road, but shouldn't be hard to roll to the side (I realized I should worn trail maintenance gear/gloves - the jacket & gloves I was wearing would have easily torn...)Fossil creek was fine today.\u00a0Because of the uphill & the \"bump\" to prevent the creek from draining down the road you can't see the conditions from the car -\u00a0I recommend stopping the car (once the road is clear) and have a look on foot\u00a0before continuing, just in case snow melt is making that crossing unsafe.Continued to the trail head, where some deer were hanging out.

I opted to hike to the west trail head first, returning to the junction, and then hiking to the south trail head. Mileage, if one does all of the trail is just under 5 miles. The terrain is mostly level, some minor hills. The hike down to the trails is a bit steep, but made somewhat easier by the stairs.This hike is a wonderful woods hike. The hike to the south trail head closely follows Bug Gulch Creek, which this trip was full of water.\u00a0 The trail to the west trail also follows the creek, but not as closely as the south trail. Hiker FYI: there is a water/sewer treatment plant a the end of the west trail, with access pints to the sewer lines along this trail. At one point, a small one, the odor is a bit strong, but isolated to that area. During the early summer there are many berries to be had, salmonberry, thimble berry and blackberry.Today's hike was great.

There was a work crew near the center, so things were a little noisy, but they were doing work that needed to be done. From the center (the far side of the powwow field) I turned right onto the steep west park road to catch the loop trail again, turned right on the loop, and then turned right at the first trail intersection that came up to get to the North Beach Trail. \u00a0Overall, the trails are in good condition. They are, of course, pretty muddy in some places, and some of the steps down to the North Beach are slick and even loose. Be careful of your footing there. The \u00a0stairs leading up from South Beach to the bluffs seemed to be in better condition, and that stretch is a great thigh burner! Other notes: most water fountains have not be turned on yet.

There are a couple of nice campsites here though you would have to deal with all the charcoal from the burned trees.  The lake is pretty shallow.

For safety, be sure to follow the Cascade Lake Trail across the road at the south end of the lake. It will take you behind the campground and drop you at the swimming beach. It's much safer than trying to walk along the road.\u00a0This trail is beautiful and nice for dogs. There are some rooty areas that made my dog jump, thinking he'd seen a snake. We saw deer and birds, woodpeckers and vultures. I saw a couple other solo hikers and families near the lakes.

I saw some kids jumping off the rocks a bit further, then of there's the bridge where more people were testing their courage.

We were hoping to do Mountain Lake, but the road was closed just past Camp Moran due to downed trees. So we parked and hopped on the nearby Cascade Lake trail. We did the entire loop (counter-clockwise), most of which was great. There was one super steep section near Camp Moran, which I think I'm glad we were going down and not up. A fair number of others out on the trail, but not bad. Even with the 90-100% chance of rain this afternoon we didn't notice a single drop.

The roads to the high trail-heads are still snow covered which made for a bit of road walking from Godman Camp.Road conditions:Skyline road: Snow free from the North to within a couple hundred yards of Godman camp. Patchy snow from Godman to NF-300 intersection. Friday I high-centered myself trying to take the road around Bluewood ski area but with adventurous memorial day weekend traffic it may now be passable.NF-4608 (to Teepee TH):\u00a0~1-3 feet deep continuous snow from the Skyline road to Teepee TH.NF-300 (to Twin Buttes/Slick ear TH): ~1-3 feet deep mostly continuous snow for about a mile from the Skyline road. Upper portion of road near TH is melted out.Trail conditions (There are two Grizzly Bear Ridge trails in the Tucannon-Wenaha called by different names ... confusing ... I use the NF trail #'s below):Mt. Misery trail: Mostly covered in 0-3' deep snow from Teepee TH to Oregon Butte.Grizzly Bear Ridge (#3121): A primitive ridge line route from Oregon Butte to Crooked Creek. There is no sign for this trail Jct at either end and I saw only\u00a0a few\u00a0patches of tread.Crooked Creek trail: I met Crooked Creek Trail at 3600' after heading downhill from a saddle on Grizzly Bear Ridge. From this point the trail is somewhat overgrown and brushy to where it crosses Crooked Creek at about 3200'. From here the trail is sparse and badly overgrown for about a mile. It gets better as it climbs the hillside but has plenty of downed trees to hop over. The trail crosses the creek\u00a0twice then Melton Creek. All knee deep fords.\u00a0Trail is well maintained from Melton Creek to the Wenaha River.Wenaha River trail: From Crooked Creek to Butte Creek the trail is over grown but easy to follow through burned terrain. Crooked Creek can be crossed on logs. From Butte Creek to the Jct with Grizzly Bear Ridge trail (#3103) the trail is faint, brushy, and disappears at times. You leave the burn and enter lovely\u00a0forest about a mile west of Butte Creek (which was a mid-thigh ford). From Grizzly Bear Ridge trail (#3103)\u00a0Jct to Slick Ear Jct the tread is good and easy to follow with only a few downed trees. Rock Creek at the Grizzly Bear Ridge Jct was a knee deep ford. I met a lot of rattlesnakes along the Wenaha and accidentally stepped on one in an overgrown part of the trail.\u00a0Both parties were surprised and alarmed.Slick ear trail: Upper portion is in good condition. Through the forest there are frequent small blowdown. Near the Jct with the Wenaha River Trail there is a large difficult section of blow-down that you have to work around for about 100 yards. The trail fords Slick Ear Creek six times, all were wet feet today.Grizzly Bear Ridge trail (#3103): Up high the trail follows an old road bed that is well maintained. The road ends in meadows at which point you follow trail that becomes faint but followable as you move in and out of burned forest. The trail then drops to the Wenaha River on well graded switchbacks that were overgrown along Rock Creek.", "date": "May 29, 2017"}, {"comment": "Who would have thought a 5 mile, downhill trail would be a hard way to start a trip?  The trailhead was hard to find because of a recent forest fire and a downed tree obstructing the round.  Also there was a road not on the map that confused us.  The left fork leads to the trailhead, and we parked near the downed tree and walked to the end of the road where the trail began.  The trail started on a ridge and was easy to follow, but once we descended into a creek drainage it was unmaintained, with chest high brush obscuring what was left of the trail, and countless downed trees.  There were also many creek crossings which involved wading.  To top it off, it poured down rain the whole time, and despite rain gear we were drenched when we arrived at the Wenaha River end of the trail\rWe hiked along the river the next day to the Grizzly Bear Ridge trail, intending to camp at Meadow Springs.  Initially it was easy to follow, though unmaintained.  After we reached the ridge top there was recent fire damage which completely destroyed the trail.  Route finding was relatively easy with map and compass, but there were so many downed trees that it was a slog.  After the fire damaged area, the trail was easy to follow.  We never found Meadow Springs, and ended up hiking almost back to the road.  Coyote Spring was easy to find and we camped on the ridge top near it, with spectacular views.

We just stopped at the Lewis River Country Store to buy ours which was on the way. Just know that they don't have day passes for you to purchase in the parking lot (as you would with a discover pass) and a ranger was there checking for permits when we got back from our snowshoe. Unfortunately, there were a couple of cars we saw receive tickets which is why I thought I would mention it.The road to the snow park was covered in snow the whole way up. We were heading up around 8:30 and the snow had not been plowed yet. We were in a Subaru Forester and made it just fine but the snow was deep, so I would recommend a four wheel drive/all wheel drive car with a high clearance. I included a picture of the road for your reference.Once we arrived in the parking lot around 9, it was packed with mostly snowmobilers. There were only a couple of spots open that we, fortunately, were able to snag.\u00a0We decided to take the Pine Marten trail instead of the road and the snow was quite deep here. I have included a picture of this as well. The trail was easy enough to follow and we later found out that it was because a snowshoer in front of us had to make those tracks through knee deep snow. We sure appreciated it! After about a half mile, this trail comes out on to the road for another half mile. There were quite a few snowmobilers, but they were all very courteous and slowed down when driving by us. Just make sure to stay to the side so they have plenty of room.\u00a0Once we reached the trailhead we followed the path as it meandered through the trees. Overall, the trail was very pleasant and gradually went up and down through the woods. The few times the sun peaked through the clouds, it made the trail sparkle like a winter wonderland. I would highly recommend this trail for a clear day. Eventually, we ran into the snowshoer who had forged a path for us and decided to give him a break by forging our own path the rest of the way. It was very easy to tell which way to go even though there weren't tracks and it was easy to spot the blue diamonds along the way. What wasn't easy was forging the path! We were fine with the snowshoes but it was deep and slow going. We finally reached the lake and wished we could have enjoyed it longer as the waterfall was beautiful and the lake was peaceful, but it was far too cold to hang out long so we headed back.

The trailhead is on your right fairly soon after you start down Icicle Creek Road. \u00a0 With countless switchbacks my feet were feeling a bit like jello by the time we climbed almost 2,000 feet to the ridge. \u00a0Then hiked another 2/10 of a mile to the eastern tip of the ridge where we enjoyed the views while eating lunch \u00a0Stunning views even with the very cloudy weather. \u00a0I very much want to do this hike again on a sunny day so that I can really enjoy the beauty of this area while going along the ridge. \u00a0Trail is in excellent condition\u00a0Afterwards we drove through the orchard country as the fruit trees were in full bloom and simply stunning. \u00a0From Seattle we took 90 to 97 via Cle Elum. \u00a0Took a bit over two hours to get there without any stops. \u00a0On the way back we had to stop at Dairy Queen in Cle Elum so that I could begin to rebuild my energy stores with a Blizzard!", "date": "2 days ago"}, {"comment": "We started our hike off at around 10:15 this morning. The sign to the trailhead off of Icicle Road is pretty small and easy to miss, so make sure to keep an eye out. There was plenty of room for parking when we arrived, but the parking lot was packed when we returned to our car around 12:45 pm.The trail is in great condition, and we were to the saddle in about an hour and ten minutes.\u00a0The elevation gain felt pretty gradual, so this seems like it would be a manageable hike for most. Not much by way of wildflowers yet; we saw very few just starting to bloom.At the saddle, we headed to the right, and in just a few minutes, we hit the clearing with views of Leavenworth. It was cloudy this morning, so some of our views were a bit obstructed, but it was definitely worth it to hike extra little stretch to see the more expansive views.On our way down, we encountered lots of hikers on their way up.

We made it to the trailhead around 3:30pm after a rough, slow (very slow) slog up 4109 in a Subaru Forester; a Honda CRV also made it to a trailhead but the remaining vehicles were all high clearance. \u00a0The hike itself was lovely -- we took Ed's trail (#180A) up to the summit (#180B), then took the old forest service road (#180) back to the parking lot, making it a visually varied loop. \u00a0Ed's trail has a couple sections of rocky scramble, but nothing serious; the dog was able to make it up the rocky scramble areas as well. \u00a0Numerous wildflowers are blooming (penstemon, star tulip, wooley sunflower, western bistort, hairbell, etc.) but some of the flowers are past their prime and have already gone to seed. \u00a0The huckleberries are ripe and tasty. \u00a0The views were tremendous. \u00a0Be careful not to mis-step along Ed's trail: one wrong step could cause a very long fall. We made it back to the vehicle by 5:45. On the \"drive\" back down 4109, we passed a group of folks who had parked about 1 mile into the rough 4109 and were hiking the rest of the road (another 1.6 miles up). \u00a0We exited the area on L-1100, which was in fabulous condition. \u00a0Another option would have been to continue back to 41 and head west, but there was a pretty ugly/ deep washout at the 4109/ 41 junction which we wanted to avoid. \u00a0A far better route if one wants to hike Ed's trail would be to come in from the south and tack on Ed's trail to one of the other Silver Star hikes. \u00a0Here are some interesting references on Silver Star and its surrounds:https://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_MEDIA/stelprdb5160930.pdfhttps://www.wnps.org/plant_lists/counties/skamania/silver_star_mountain.doc\u00a0https://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_MEDIA/stelprdb5160934.pdfhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_Star_Mountain_(Skamania_County,_Washington)http://www.oregonhikers.org/field_guide/Silver_Star_Mountain_Loop_HikeHappy hiking!", "date": "Jul 27, 2017"}, {"comment": "The last 2.5 miles of the road driving up to the trailhead are NO JOKE.

If you do happen to make it to the trailhead, wow, what a beautiful hike you have in store for you! We were lucky enough to get a clear day, and got views of St Helens, Rainier, Adams, Hood, and Jefferson. Plus those wildflowers! We took Ed's trail up and then looped back on the alternative trail. It was a fairly easy and quick hike. Pack your sunscreen as there is little tree cover. The bugs seemed to think of me as a friend, because once I worked up a sweat they were swarming me. They left my partner in peace, which given my aversion to bugs was an annoyance in and of itself. I think they were just flies??? Maybe I don't want to know?? The trail was mosquito free though. Also, I believe the wta info page says there's no pass required, but on the road on the way up there is a \"Discover Pass Required\" sign.

I hadn't realized that it was marked with pink flagging and so missed the trail. After back tracking a bit, I proceeded along the trail. Only 5 blowndowns the entire length, all of which are easily passable while staying on the trail. About 2/3rd the way to the top the trail does get very narrow and steep. When almost to the top, the trail ends at an abandon logging road where it's maybe 1/4-1/3 mile more to the actual summit. Don't expect any fantastic view from the top. Almost the entire area around the summit is surrounded by trees 15-20ft tall. All in all, it was a enjoyable hike.", "date": "Jun 2, 2007"}],

There were intermittent snow patches not far from the first set of ropes, but I didn't really feel I needed to put my microspikes on as I carry poles and winter hiking boots. There are 4 sets of ropes in total, two for the first section, one, then the last one. The first two ropes/first section felt the least stable. These ropes were thinner than other ones I've encountered crossing headlands on the Olympic coast. I definitely recommend a pair of gloves that you don't mind bashing on the ropes / grabbing onto dirty tree branches with.\u00a0Leaving on the first ferry from Edmonds was a great idea. We had the summit to ourselves for ~30 minutes, but passed quite a few more people on our way down than we'd seen coming in. A lot of other hikers we encountered turned around due to not feeling prepared for the rope sections, and I think this was wise. Had there been any rain at all, I myself would not have felt comfortable\u00a0scrambling on the exposed landing at the top. Take your time and choose your path wisely (and remember you have to climb down whatever you climb up).\u00a0You can also add a small detour to Marymere Falls and I highly recommend it! When you start hearing the waterfall at the bottom of the trail, then come off near the sign, hang a left. It's muddy in sections but I still didn't feel the need to put my gaiters on, though the rest of my group did.

Caught the first ferry over from Edmonds and got to the trailhead around 8 due to the renewed construction on Highway 101 at Lake Crescent.

Short, but for me a great fitness check of just how out of shape I got during the winter. The trail is overall in good shape. One tree down just after the first leveling off of the trail at the small clearing before the climbing continues. It is an easy enough step over. Another tree across the trail further up, but easy enough to duck under. I was nervous about possible snow/frost making things slick and dangerous on the scramble section, but was pleased to find no snow cover remaining and nothing too slick despite some frost on the rocks. The warm sun helped a lot even though the temps were still around freezing. Swung by Marymere Falls at the end for a little side cool-down. Great hike and fantastic views.", "date": "Mar 19, 2018"}],

Beware- Don't try to cross the marsh between 2 of the easterly potholes, they are thigh deep, we checked ;) .\u00a0Enjoyed some bare foot camp time in the evening. Saw/heard signs of coyotes sniffing around the camp overnight.Day 2 : Headed back to the scree line on the south rim of the canyon up the very steep and scrambly trail on the right to reach the first tier of the mesa. Impressive views! Scramble up to the passes between the columns to enter the Dusty Lake basin from above or just take in the views. Continue along this middle mesa then ascent up to an even higher one! Took a trail up to the top of the cataract wall for the most elevated views of the area and across to the Windmills and beyond!

We started at the Ancient Lakes trailhead, not too long into the hike you hit beautiful views in an unexpected part of Washington. It's not a long distance to where the campsite areas are, but it takes awhile scaling down the mountain next to the waterfall. We had our pup which made it a bit more difficult but still fun trekking across the rocks like mountain goats. Be careful in this area, especially with your dog though! There were a ton of campers, especially larger (and louder) groups but we managed to score a nice site overlooking the lake and away from the crowds. After setting up camp mid-day, we still had time to explore and made it up to a sweet spot overlooking Dusty Lake. Would definitely recommend for a nice little overnight backpacking trip!", "date": "9 days ago"}, {"comment": "Is the desert beautiful? You bet!

A quick run into Dusty Lake then it was time to enjoy dinner and a very pretty sunset. The next morning we again dropped down to the river and explored to the north.

This is a real adventure!According to the USFS website, there is still a road washout on Forest Road 26. However, you can drive to the Green River Horse Camp trailhead from FR 26 coming from the south. There is a Road Closed sign just north of the turnoff to 2612 from 26 as there is still a washout on the north end, so it is not accessible from that side until the road is repaired. But the red warning sign on the Goat Mountain page on the WTA website (\"6/1/17: trail inaccessible; road washout\") is NOT accurate - you just have to take the route from FR 99 to 26 north, past Ryan Lake, to get there.The descriptions in the book are mostly accurate and camping spots are in the places they are reported. However GPS or equivalent smartphone app is highly recommended as at least one trailheads is challenging to find and there are multiple places where the trail has been rerouted from the Topo map.Vanson Lake and Deadman's lake are both gorgeous, accessible, very tranquil and quiet in September.One major concern: there is a trail washout very early into the hike from the Green River Horse Camp west on 213 just as it crosses over into private land. It is possible that there is a reroute further back the trail; I didn't backtrack to see but it certainly wasn't evident or marked. As of this writing, the washout is 10-15 deep gully about 20 feet across. It is not passable. I was able to track north about 300 feet\u00a0by doing so hiked around\u00a0the gully but this required pushing through deep brush and over a number of downed trees in wet, slippery conditions. It's really hazardous and I've written USFS to see if it can be addressed. There are other places where brief off-trail rerouting is necessary but none are what I would consider a hazard.Expect patches of snow this time of year on the 217 side especially if heading up to Vanson Peak. Daytime highs were in the upper 50s and night temperatures dropped to freezing on Goat Mountain.Good berry picking on 217, which is much better kept than 213. My mileage for the loop was 25 miles, including the short hike up to Vanson Peak and back. There is AT&T cell service on Vanson Peak but none elsewhere on the trail.", "date": "Sep 21, 2017"}, {"comment": "The west end of this trail has not been road accessible since Weyerhaeuser locked their gates back in the early 1980's. This year the east end is also not accessible due to washout on FR26 and closure of FR99 by a locked gate down at FR25. I got in by following the Vanson Peak trail over Vanson Peak and down to Vanson Lake, which is very near the west end of the trail. The trail has not seen maintenance yet this year and there are some substantial logs across the way, so I wouldn't recommend it for horses, but there are less than a dozen significant obstacles. There is some overgrowth, but not much, and no risk of losing the way. There are signs at all junctions. As far as Vanson Peak junction, the way is through a postfire Douglas-fir stand, I'd guess it burned about 100 years ago. Good forest interior wildflowers. The side trails to Vanson Lake (trout, good camping, running water) and Vanson Peak (former fire lookout site, good views) are short and recommended. From Vanson Peak junction to Deadman Lake the trail wanders up and down through subalpine forest (mostly noble fir) and brushy meadows (mostly huckleberries) with occasional views and lots of mosquitoes and wildflowers (they go together with recent snowmelt). No water until Deadman Lake, which is quite pretty, has many good campsites, sandy shoreline, swimming, lots of trout. No water anywhere east of Deadman Lake, either. I spent the night at the lake, warm and buggy. Next morning, left camp about dawn, hiking east. The trail climbs a forested hill and then slabs along lower Goat Mountain through meadows with lots of Cascade rhododendron in bloom, and then crests on the ridge of Goat Mountain and enters the blast zone of the 1980 eruption. It's a pretty spectacular transition. At this point I also picked up a southwest breeze and the bug problem went away. From here, the trail wanders east, mostly on the south side of the crest of Goat Mountain, for about three miles. Much of the route is through the 1980 scorch zone; most of the affected trees have since fallen/burned/rotted but a few blasted snags remain. Part of the route is outside the scorch zone and retains a nice subalpine forest of noble fir, subalpine fir, mountain hemlock, Alaska yellow-cedar, western white pine, lodgepole pine, and Douglas-fir. Much of it is meadow and when I was there the Erythronium, penstemon, lupines, and tiger lilies were in especially abundant bloom. I don't think I've ever seen such a density of tiger lilies. Near the east end of Goat Mountain the trail starts to descend fairly steeply and I stopped and turned back. Did a side trip to climb to the summit of Goat Mountain (follow the goat trails), about 5200 ft, nice views, lots of evidence of goat activity. Got back to the Vanson Peak trailhead by 3:30. Home in time for dinner.", "date": "Jul 14, 2017"}, {"comment": "Attempted Goat Mountain today but did not make it to the trailhead. FR 26 is drivable for the most part with some minor obstacles (some potholes, branches on road) until mile 6 where the first major wash out will prevent further vehicles to pass. We decided to park and walk the 4 miles to the trail head. There is a side trail on the left that would take you across the washout. The paved trail was easily walkable with gradual incline but in some spots no reprieve from the sun. We reached the second major wash out at about mile 8. Again, there is a side trail on the left to take you across the wash out. We ventured deeper and found a great waterfall to cool off at and decided to call it quits after. Didn't make it to the trail head for the actual hike.

Stayed at the first pond/lake along the trail.  The water was crisp and clear.  There are a few fairly established campsites, one with a fire ring.  Stayed the night there and hiked up to Goat Mtn the next day.  Along the hike, we stopped several times to take in the scenery and the wildlife.  Seen a small elk herd, a bear, grouse, deer and a goat.  The goat was actually sunning its self on Goat Mountain which was cool to see. Got to within 400 yards of the goat but couldn't go any further without risking life and limb.  Had a five mountain view on a very sunny clear day.  The blueberries were out in force.  Was very nice to pick a few berries along the way.  Returned to camp and hiked out in the dark.", "date": "Sep 10, 2016"}, {"comment": "Attempted to hike Goat Mountain over the 4th of July weekend.

The snow conditions were perfect today!\u00a0But if these factors were not in place, you will need snowshoes for this for sure. We just timed it perfectly.At the end of the pavement of the Middle Fork Teanaway Road, still 2 miles from the trailhead, we encountered an impassable pile of snow blocking the road. Maybe it was intentionally left there to not allow vehicles any further and only snowmobiles and XC skiers. If not, that is pretty inconsiderate and the plow simply had to turn and push the snow off to the side. The road behind it was completely covered in compact snow and ice, but our Subaru would've totally made it at least to the Middle Fork TH before the road starts going uphill.\u00a0So be prepared for 4 miles round trip of road walking in addition to the 11 mile hike.Here is my full trip report with photos:\u00a0http://www.nwhikers.net/forums/viewtopic.php?t=8026544", "date": "Feb 12, 2018"}, {"comment": "Initially I wanted to give this hike 2 stars. Motorcycles have chewed up much of the first mile and one half and that never leaves me in a good mood.

The austere soils along the summit ridge and the otherwise harsh conditions make for some eye dazzling pops of colorful flowers. WOW!The guidebook entry says, \"10 miles RT\", our GPS measured 12.16 although there was a little wandering around. We did not visit Yellow Hill.There were several good vistas along the ridge with views of the Stuarts, the Teanaway Peaks, and all of the snow clad peaks along the divide. Camping would be good although lack of water availability is an issue. BTW, if you bring your canine companion the ONLY water was at 2.9 miles from the trailhead.Snow still exists but is melting fast. It is easy to navigate. The trailhead is a short distance past the Middle Fork Trail head as mentioned in the directions. It is however OFF the logging road a 100m and is NOT signed. A Northwest Forest Pass is NOT accepted here, a Discovery Pass is required. While I'm on the subject of corrections 2800' gain (as stated in guidebook) is ONLY the difference between trail head and summit.

A friend has a cabin down the road, so I wanted to check out the area. I was originally going to try the MF Teanaway river trail, but you have to ford the river and to get to it. No way that was going to happen with spring runoff. Anyway as plan B took this trail. No trailhead markers, had to find it on my GPS map. It's kind of a short spur road to park there. Anyway the trail is obviously used my motorbikes, but I didn't see nary a one. Or any other hikers. Didn't go all the way to the peak, just wanted to get a nice up and back hike. It's moderate steep, probably an old logging road, so it's a really easy trail. Not technical at all. I only did about 2.5 miles of it, 1000' gain. Plenty workout for a sunday afternoon. Lupine flowers were just starting to come out. Some nice views, even after just 2 miles plenty payoff of valley views to make it worth the hike.

Some of the deeper motorcycle ruts are challenging with the icy snow and slippery loose rock. Once closer to Yellow Hill the trail becomes more pleasant.

However, we went 5 miles and reached a high point we thought might be the peak just before our turnaround time (started late, after 11am), but upon looking at GPS data it looks like the peak was still well over a mile away.

We knew we wouldn't see much of the glacier, as we were quickly above the cloud line already, so turned back after two miles of the stretch between Elk Lake campsite and the glacier, and headed to Olympic Ranger Station meadows to camp. Rain kept on that day, and we tried to dry off with a big fire we built with other hikers that night, which was a great opportunity to hear stories from hikers from all over the world. The next day was clear and sunny, which made for a pleasant hike back to the car. Met a coyote, owl, several little critters, birds, and elk. Beautiful hike, and a great intro for anyone wanting to get acquainted with the Olympic Rainforest.", "date": "Aug 1, 2016"}],

We had no intentions on doing the whole trail at this time of the year and was mostly out there to test out new gear, including all my new rain gear. If you don't mind mud the trail was okay until we got around the 3 mile mark. At that point the trail was not just muddy but under water completely. We stopped there to eat lunch and figure out what to do. Unfortunately, the\u00a0decision for us at the time was to go ahead and turn around and head back to the trail head.\u00a0", "date": "Feb 4, 2018"}, {"comment": "A friend and I parked at the Hoh River Visitor Center on Friday the 3rd and started out around noon. We were unsure of how far we would go on the first day, but had rough plans to be back Sunday afternoon.The weather was clear but cool. We ended up reaching Lewis Meadows around 6pm and setup camp right on the edge of the river. As the sun set over the sides of the mountains, we could see the peaks and snow covered trees. It was an awesome location, and we were the only ones out backpacking the trail. We saw a large group of elk, maybe 20-30, pass in front of us. We also caught a glimpse of a few deer.\u00a0The next day, we caught up on rest from travel and set out around 11am. We decided we would hike through to Elk Lake and make some lunch there. It was great to stop and have a shelter to quickly boil water and relax without our packs on. At this point, it was snowing but only a small amount. We hungout and then got ready to push further towards Glacier Meadows. Since snow was coming down, we needed gaitors and our waterproof shells. We followed the trail towards glacier meadows, and saw lots of paw marks on the trail (warnings of cougars back at the visitor center). We made it to the rope ladder just shortly before glacier meadows and decided to turn back as it was getting dark. Once we got our packs back at Elk Lake, we headed down towards Lewis Meadows to spend the last night. At this point, the snow turned to rain, and it was a pretty miserable 5ish miles in the dark. When we reached Lewis Meadows, we setup the tent and attempted a fire in the rain whilst a few deer watched.\u00a0We woke up around 6 and made breakfast before the last ~10.5 miles to the visitor center where we parked. Again, we saw nobody until we were passed 5 mile island. Again, we saw some elk and deer on the way back, who were mostly just spooked by us being out there.All in all, amazing trip that I would\u00a0recommend\u00a0as either a 2-3 night backpacking trip. The weather did get cold at night (mid 20s) but if you are prepared then it is no problem. Would do it again and hope to reach the blue glacier next time!", "date": "Nov 3, 2017"}, {"comment": "We hit the trail at the Hoh Visitor Center about 8AM on Friday in perfect weather.\u00a0 The mostly level trail was quite busy, and most of the campsites along the way were occupied.\u00a0 Other hikers had seen a herd of several dozen elk just past Mt Tom Creek camp, but we did not.\u00a0 At 12.4 miles, the trail begins the inexorable climb, only to descend again to the scenic High Hoh bridge.\u00a0 This old bridge connects two cliffs well above the river, offering lovely views.\u00a0 One contemplates the challenges that the engineers and builders faced as they constructed the span deep in the wilderness.\u00a0The last 1.5 miles to Elk Lake camp is an arduous climb, and for us, the end of a very long day.\u00a0 We arrived about 430PM.\u00a0 Be sure to get your water at Martin Creek; cold, clear and delicious.\u00a0 Elk Lake in September offers less freshness, and it will clog your filter.\u00a0 The camp is well laid out; our group took the group camp to the north.\u00a0 There are bear wires, and a very nice privy.\u00a0 Overall a great base camp.\u00a0Saturday we took a leisurely breakfast, and started the climb to Blue Glacier.\u00a0 Although listed at 3.5 miles to the apex of the lateral moraine, be sure to devote plenty of time.\u00a0 The trail is steep, you must negotiate the famous ladder at the washout, and the last mile is a brutal rock stepper at about 40 degrees.\u00a0 The out and back took us nearly 6.5 hours, although we took time to enjoy the bountiful blueberries just past Glacier Meadows camp.\u00a0 Be sure to take your fresh water at the glacial pond as you exit the meadows and begin the final rock field climb.\u00a0 Cold and sweet; the lateral moraine does not manifest any further water sources in September.\u00a0The views at the top were expansive.\u00a0 Bring a warm parka.\u00a0Sunday we did the 15.4 miles out in the rain, which cooled us down to make for a pleasant day.\u00a0 We took our time as the creeks and waterfalls were accentuated with the new precipitation.\u00a0I believe that if time was not an issue, this route would be best done in 4 nights and not two.\u00a0 However, for avid hikers with tight schedules, it is reasonable to reproduce our itinerary.", "date": "Sep 15, 2017"}, {"comment": "First thing first, there is a full fire ban on the entire park, fuel stoves only on all trails. The only place where fire is allowed is at the camp sites at the visitor center where fire grates are established.\u00a0I started late Saturday and hiked to Happy Four campsite at 5.7mi. The River here is low, but you have easy access to the river.\u00a0Next morning I went up to a small not well known site at 12.4mi right off the trail. The river narrows here, a wonderful small rapids gorge, a beautiful site with a trail that leads to the river through the brush. Bugs were very mild despite the fire ban.\u00a0Monday I hiked to Glacier Meadows, left my pack and took my day bag up and extra mile for the view. Gorgeous. Had lunch and came back down. Tuesday I hiked to Five Mile Island. The bugs were a little worse here because there is some slow moving water, but still very pleasant. Last day I hiked out and hit the road.\u00a0Things to be aware of: Fire Ban, Trail has a lot of roots and rocks and is a very hard compacted trail, be sure to have proper footwear. It is still pretty hot, I left the fly off my tent every night. Hydrate yourself, there are sections of the trail where you cannot access the river for several miles and most of the streams and creeks are running dry by the trail so fill up water when you have the opportunity.\u00a0\u00a0All in all, a very worth while trip!\u00a0", "date": "Sep 2, 2017"}, {"comment": "To get up a perch overlooking the peaks of Mt. Olympus and Blue Glacier, there are many options for organizing your trip.\u00a0 It's about 18 miles and 4700' elevation gain from the Hoh trailhead to end of the end of the lateral moraine spur (the endpoint of the hike), and most of the elevation gain comes in the last 6 miles.\u00a0 There is another potential endpoint, the terminal moraine, but the ranger told me that spur is hard to follow and the endpoint is the bottom of Blue Glacier rather than the view across Blue Glacier to the summit of Mt. Olympus afforded by the lateral moraine spur.I opted to camp 10.5 miles in, at Lewis Meadows, which made for a 16 mile dayhike with 4300' gain on day 2.\u00a0 Lewis Meadows had ample tent sites, and I was able to get one of the five or so tucked away riverside sites.\u00a0 Lewis does not require reservations for parties under 6 people.\u00a0 I considered going a bit further on day 1, but the next two sites, at 12.4 and 13.2 miles in and also unpermitted, had only one and three tent sites respectively and were forested.\u00a0 If they were occupied, you had to go on to at least Martin Creek or Elk Lake.\u00a0 In the end, I preferred the\u00a0open gravel bar expanse\u00a0of the Hoh River at Lewis Meadows and the longer dayhike.From Glacier Meadows camp, you ascend the well-marked lateral moraine trail through steep meadows followed by a well-established gravel path up through the moraine.\u00a0 The endpoint is a narrow ridge with an awe-inspiring view to the spiky peaks of Mt. Olympus and the frozen blue pocked river that is Blue Glacier.\u00a0 The vegetation on the ridge is worn away so it is dusty among the large rocks, and it was quite windy up there with lots of dust blowing around.Even though the destination was the close-up view of Mt. Olympus, it should be emphasized that the long relatively flat walk through the lush Hoh River valley\u00a0is a meditation and features every shade of green you can conjure.\u00a0 The walk among the towering giants and intermittent views of the mighty Hoh upstream and downstream are plenty of destination for many.\u00a0 At the impressive High Hoh bridge, you see the river at its most upstream in a narrow deep canyon (picture below) and the confluence of the Hoh River and Glacier Creek, which all descend from the various glaciers of Mt. Olympus.Miraculously timed this outing to optimize three factors:\u00a0 not too cold in the evening, bugs were minimal, and an abundance of blueberries\u00a0(starting above Elk Lake).\u00a0 The only factor which would have made it more ideal was to do it earlier in the season to see more wildflowers in Glacier Meadows, but that would have likely meant more bugs.\u00a0 I did see a herd of elk in the Hoh River (on the road just before the visitor center), a pair of black salamanders, a couple of grouse, and maybe 30-40 tiny hopping frogs on the short section between Martin Creek and Elk Lake, particularly in the late afternoon.\u00a0 It was hard to avoid stepping on the frogs in some parts.There was one significant obstacle on the trail about 1/3 mile before Glacier Meadows.\u00a0 A slide has wiped out a section of the trail, and the park has installed a cable and rope ladder that you descend on the way in and ascend on the way out.\u00a0 I found it quite treacherous because of its length, its near vertical angle,\u00a0and the precariousness of some of the rungs.\u00a0 In addition, there were rocks falling from above as I was descending the ladder, even though nobody was above.\u00a0 Other WTA trip reports this summer include pictures of the ladder.\u00a0 The ranger at the Hoh visitor center said there were no plans to repair the ladder, which has been there 3-4 years, because the view is that those who are hardy enough to get to this point will not find it a significant challenge.\u00a0 If you feel differently, as I do, the ranger said they welcome comments (at their website) in support of repairing the trail and removing the ladder to improve both accessibility and safety.Met a research group (with very heavy packs) from the National Park Service\u00a0installing surveillance\u00a0to determine\u00a0whether martens have come back in the park and also a work group from the Conservation Corps who were doing trail maintenance up to both Elk Lake and Hoh Lake.\u00a0 Mules had hauled up equipment for the work party.", "date": "Aug 28, 2017"}],

The road to the trailhead was actually closed. We parked at the Bagley Loop Trailhead and hiked up the road to the what we hoped was the Lake Ann trailhead. We trudged through four to six inches of snow and thankfully found the trail marker. From there it was decided to either make it to the lake or head back if deemed unsafe. Lucky for us, it appeared at least a few people had made the trek after the snow had stopped falling. Our pants and boots were soaked to the shins, but we made it to our\u00a0gorgeous destination. Lake Ann and Mt. Shuksan are absolute\u00a0sights to behold, especially in the unexpected layer of snow that greeted us. I fully understand why this is such a popular hike. The backdrop of Mt. Shuksan and its glaciers against the calm of this little alpine lake is a simply stunning visual to behold. I'm glad we brought a few beers to toast this mighty visage. We walked about for an hour and half or so before heading back. All told we started out about 9:45 and made it back to the car around 5:00. A glorious day indeed.", "date": "Oct 15, 2017"}, {"comment": "Lake Ann had been on our to-hike list for the entire summer and somehow we hadn't gotten to it even as we neared the end of the fall hiking season. This was probably going to be our last chance before next year, which would explain some of the stubbornness we exhibited in the rest of this trip report.We were prepared for some snow to be on the trail on Saturday the 14th, but we hadn't expected the road to the trailhead to be closed altogether. It was. We parked about 1.5 miles from the trailhead and hiked up the closed, increasingly icy roadway. It was overcast. Cold winds whipped our faces and we began to doubt the wisdom of the day\u2019s adventure. The roadway did afford some pretty spectacular views of the surrounding mountains:The area by the trailhead was so snowy that we actually walked past it a good ways before doubling back.Once we actually found the Lake Ann trailhead, it was clear that no one had attempted to hike the trail at least since the last snow. There were no bootprints whatsoever, and probably 4-6 inches of snow at the trailhead sign.We agreed before going any further that if we began to lose the trail, or if anyone felt unsafe, or if we reached any exposed traverses, we would turn around. We thought it quite likely that we would lose the trail, what with no bootprints to follow and boulder fields to cross.So we began. I\u2019d recommend poles and microspikes at the very least, snow boots or waterproof boots preferable if I were going to attempt this again. My trail runners were pretty much instantly soaked through.We descended through the subalpine forest and the wind immediately abated and it become more comfortable.Although tramping through the snow and making boot prints was tiring, at no point did we feel in danger of losing the trail:Even the route through the first boulder field was fairly obvious.\u00a0We reached the second subalpine forest without difficulty where we saw some fall colors sprinkled throughout, and began to ascend towards the saddle. The saddle was probably the only spot where we may have accidentally cut a switchback or two without realizing it, as the trail became slightly harder to follow with all the snow. Even still, the ascent did not feel dangerous\u2014it was not particularly steep or exposed, and microspikes and poles did the job just fine. This may change as more snow continues to accumulate. At this point our feet were wet and cold, but apart from that we felt fine.We actually couldn\u2019t believe it when we reached Lake Ann and the view of Mt. Shuksan beyond. With the snowy weather swirling, the craggy rock faces riddled with snow, and the otherworldly glaciers, it felt like something out of Lord of the Rings..and we had it all to ourselves.\u00a0Magnificent.Not sure if I would attempt this hike with substantially more snow than 4-6 inches, but with that relatively small amount of snow, it was doable. The view was more than worth it. Looking forward to returning in the summer!In summary:\u00a0An extremely snowy hike, but the view was more than worth it. We left the car at the parking lot at 9:45am, reached the trailhead at 10:30am, reached Lake Ann/Mt. Shuksan viewpoint at about 1:15pm. 3.5 hours out, 2.5 hours back. We really hustled on the way back, as our feet were getting cold. It was much easier to follow the path with our bootprints in the snow.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0", "date": "Oct 14, 2017"}, {"comment": "A new favorite...

Fall colors, more blueberries, increasing views of Mt. Baker as it rose above Mt. Ann and Lake Ann. Curtis Glacier is epic, and you can see down the valley all the way to Baker Lake. I hiked for about an hour, passing the North Cascades National park sign and stopping on a large flat rock to take in the views. Watched three goats graze and a curious pika circle about.Needed to get home so I headed back to the lake, packed up, and began the trek home.

The familiar smell of rain in the meadow was something I had almost forgotten after the long dry summer here in the Pacific Northwest.My hope is that the\u00a0precipitation will be enough to douse the fires that have been devastating the area, and bring some much needed moisture back to the parched landscape. \u00a0On the ride out of MRNP the fire crews were still battling on the ridge at Alta Vista and Crystal Mountain. \u00a0The smoke was clearly visible from the road heading north on 410.\u00a0 Thanks to those fire fighting crews for their efforts to contain the blaze.

We arrived at the parking area near the power lines around 10 am with a few cars in the lot. The lot had a few patches of snow and shallow ice, but you could get pretty much any car up there easily. You couldn't drive all the way up to the trailhead under the power lines due to substantial snow and ice on the road, but it was an easy and short walk.Based on looking at the snowpack and the NWAC report, we decided to leave the snowshoes in the car because we thought the snow would be quite consolidated. It was a good decision. With the blue skies and hard snow, it felt like spring!The first part of the trail was very hard-packed snow. It was a bit awkward walking up the wooden steps since parts of them were completely snow covered and some of then had a narrow, tall ridge of snow just large enough to get in your way. The stream crossings were relatively straightforward, but you had to be a bit careful climbing down the small snowbanks to get to them.Eventually, we ended up on a completely snow-covered trail. The snow was again quite hard and crusty with a bit of give to it. We didn't see the summer creek crossing at all. We were scoping out a place to ford the creek when a helpful backpacker mentioned that there was a really good crossing up the way.We instead followed the subtle bootpath and stayed on the right of the creek until we entered the exposed slopes of the valley with numerous avalanche chutes. There was a ton of hard avalanche debris over the area, but it looked quite old. There was sufficient hard snow to get over the talus field easily.We were looking at a variety of sketchy crossings, but we decided to keep on hiking upstream to see if a good one arose. Eventually, we reached the crossing the backpacker had mentioned. It was a very large downed tree with a snow bridge overlying it with a width of maybe 4-5 feet. There was a clear footpath over it. It was very easy to cross.Once over the creek, the path diverged into a mishmash of boot and snowshoe prints. We intermittently followed them and made our own way. At the area where the switchbacks for the summer should have been, there was no trail. Some brave soul had kicked steps straight up the ridge.We followed up in those steps, occasionally having to kick our own. The route was steep, probably 30-40 degrees. The snow was incredibly hard and crusty and sometimes so hard that you couldn't kick steps into it. We pulled ourselves up with the trekking poles which didn't get too much purchase in the snow. It was manageable and felt reasonably safe, but a slip and tumble would have been very bad. An ice axe could have been handy if only to get better purchase on the snow.Eventually the trail flattened out and there was a clear path to the lake. The lake was completely frozen over. It was sunny, with beautiful views.We then made our way down. We decided to don microspikes because of how icy it was coming up. We made it to where the top of the switchbacks should have been hoping to find an easier route than we ascended, but there was none. We decided to do out best route-finding by traversing across the mellowest slopes all the way down.That did not go as planned. No matter how we tried, the mellow slopes all eventually terminated in steep slopes. We ended up descending very carefully nose-over-toes on our spikes to descend these steeper slopes. We sometimes had to traverse across steep slopes that were too hard to kick steps into, making us edge in with our boots. Plunge stepping was treacherous. Some parts of the snow were soft enough and some were not. We went slowly and carefully and managed to get down without incident. You didn't really *need* one, but an ice axe would have been very helpful for those parts. It's possibly we just missed where the easy descent was.Once we got lower, the snow softened up, and we plunge stepped down into the valley with an easy hike back to the car.", "date": "Feb 11, 2018"}, {"comment": "We set off on this trail after seeing that the NWAC forecast for this region was for low avalanche risk. Starting from the large overhanging power lines was hard packed snow. At this point we threw on our spikes and headed onwards.A mile in where you normally cross a log to get across a river we decided for safety sake to keep going on the western bank of the river. Knowing this we bushwhacked along and experienced at least three different types of snow; Hard packed almost ice like stuff, Slushy stuff on top of a hard crust, and powder. Before setting off on this endeavor we checked our maps and I double checked on my GAIA topo map that sticking to the western bank would safely get us to the lake. Once we set off we were determined to make it up, after our first quarter mile of bushwhacking we quickly realized this is a trail that should only be done when avalanche risk is low. The river along the valley is the stop point for most of the avalanches and could easily kill; this is one of the many deadly terrain traps.We finally got to the last 3000 feet before the lake, at this point we had to gain about 800 feet. We chose a steep but safe route up that hugged the river. Once at the top the lake was spectacular, the silence was incredible as well!Strangely enough, the lake\u2019s outlet was the only part that was not frozen, surrounding the lake there is a solid 6-8 feet of snow.On the way down, I would say cramp-ons would be your best bet, even lightly post holing would be great. The hike is STEEP, poles would be handy too. You may get by with microspikes, but I would recommend an ice axe on this trail at this time.", "date": "Feb 10, 2018"}, {"comment": "Quick note before report- I left a pair of MSR snowshoes on the road before it becomes impassable. They are gray with a red crampon, if anyone finds them please contact me- worgenftw@gmail.com.If you're headed out here, you can get to the trailhead even though you can't get down the road due to ice and snow from the plows. We parked on the other side of the tracks and headed down the road to find the trailhead. When we went the road was completely flooded out, but that was probably just due to the pouring rain, regardless due to creek crossings and snow coverage, you need waterproof gear and snow shoes.We went out trying to find a trail to snowshoe and hoping that it would be snowing up in the pass. We were disappointed to find that it was still raining, pouring in fact. However, the trail (and the road up to it past where the plow stops) were completely snow covered and we really wanted to go, so we put on our waterproof gear and went. The trail was easy to find and very easy to follow as the last couple hikers' footprints were still visible and they had packed the snow down some. We didn't get very far before we put on our snow shoes. Some poor guy went at some point without a pair, there were postholes most of the way to the creek before it seems he turned around. The snow was deep which made the bridges and small stream crossings difficult. Most of the streams we were able to jump or cross with the aid of poles, a couple we just walked through. There was one though that we walked upstream a bit to find a better place to cross because the log crossing was dangerous with as much snow as there was on top of it.Not long after that detour from the trail we came to Surprise Creek. It looked more like a river due to all the rain lately. We walked upstream to try to find a good place to cross, but none of the logs looked good enough to risk it so we turned around.\u00a0It was quite the adventure with a couple close calls but it was a great hike.", "date": "Feb 4, 2018"}],

Best was ponytail falls, which was a really different experience where we got to walk behind the water fall.Parking: We reached the trail head around 11.00 AM and it was super crowded, we had to park along the road. That might have been because this was the eclipse weekend, which could have been the reason for all the crowd.Trail conditions: The trail is heavily used and hence in a pretty good state. The stretch from Oneonta falls to triple falls was very steep at places and was very rocky as well, making it easy to slip - having poles would help.Shade: Most of the trail is in very good shade. There is probably small stretches from Oneonta falls to triple falls where there is no shade.Elevation gain: The trail gains elevation very gradually until the junction to Larch mountain. From here to triple falls is a comparatively steeper at places, but these are very small stretches not hard to cross. The stretch from Oneonta falls to Ponytail falls gains elevation to start with, but it is also very gradual with good switchbacks.Route: We started the hike from the trail head west of Oneonta george parking (Tr 424 in map linked below). We hiked till triple falls and turned back to complete the loop via Ponytail and horse tail falls. We walked back along the road to our car from the horsetrail falls trail head.https://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/stelprdb5227099.pdf", "date": "Aug 19, 2017"}, {"comment": "We left Bellevue at 8:30am, arrived at the Horsetail Falls Trailhead by noon. The parking lot was already full but we had no problem finding street parking on a Wed.\u00a0Most of the Horsetail Falls loop trail was in the shade; great hike for a hot day. The Upper Horsetail Fall was fun as one can walk behind the fall to get a diff perspective. We decided to made a detour to see Triple Fall. The 2-mile RT detour to Triple did not disappoint. The trail to Triple was much steeper; we jogged part of the way and got a great cardio workout.\u00a0On our return, we visited Oneonta Gorge. Getting over the log jam was tricky and we saw several bruised and bloodied limbs. There was a visible warning sign at the trailhead; it deterred very few hikers. If you decide to take the risk, make sure you are sure-footed and have strong balance.

As Oregon doesn't have an equivalent to WTA, I went with All Trails recommendation to start at Lower Horse Tail Falls, passed Upper Horse Tail Falls, turned right at the fork for Triple Falls, descended down to the old scenic high way, turning right down the high way to finally reach the Oneonta Tunnel and entrance to the Oneonta Gorge Trail. \u00a0If you're interested in a scenic view and waterfalls for an extra ~5 miles, do what I did and start at Lower Horse Tail Falls. \u00a0If you just want to do the Oneonta Gorge, drive to the Oneonta Tunnel and start from there.To the right of the tunnel there are cement stairs leading down to the water. \u00a0Follow the trail along the right hand side, crossing to the left hand side to reach the log jam. \u00a0The log jam is slipper when wet and dangerous with many people trying to pass at once. \u00a0Take your time.Continue on ~0.25 miles into the slot canyon, wading through waist deep water at points, to reach the waterfall at the end.We reached the Oneonta Tunnel around 9 AM on a Sunday and shared the canyon with ~20 people. \u00a0I would recommend to start earlier to enjoy the experience solitarily and cross the log jam more safely. \u00a0", "date": "Jul 16, 2017"}, {"comment": "Amazing sights with the waterfalls.

I was coming from the Everett area, so I took the Edmonds ferry. Taking the 7:10 ferry worked great. I arrived at the Wilderness Information Center in Port Angeles just before it opened at 9 a.m. (Note: As it has been for awhile, the WIC is temporarily at\u00a0600 East Park Avenue.)Getting a backpacking permit only took a few minutes and I was on my way. I was to the trailhead by 11 or so.\u00a0The trail to the beach is straightforward and easy. Skunk cabbage are starting to pop up all over. They should be spectacular very soon.\u00a0The only challenge to the trail was scrambling over the logs with a heavy pack. (We weren't going far, so we didn't skimp on what we brought with us. Our packs were heavier than they'd normally be.)\u00a0We arrived as the tide was getting close to being high. We had to do a bit of careful timing to get passed an outcropping of rock without getting wet shoes, but we made it easily.\u00a0We camped at a small sandy area that was raised up above the high-tide line. I'd been careful to check the tides, so I knew that the afternoon tide was going to be higher than the nighttime tide. That was reassuring. No one wants to wake up to waves hitting their tent.\u00a0We were one of about 6 groups on the beach. But it's a long beach, and we all had plenty of space.\u00a0We heard raccoons overnight, very near our tent. When we woke up in the morning, we found tracks all over. They seemed to have ignored our bear canister, which we had stashed in the woods overnight.\u00a0All in all, a lovely trip. Very easy and relaxing.\u00a0-----That's it for trip report. If that's all you needed, as you were. If you want to read my musings on my goal to backpack all year, carry on.\u00a0This was my third trip for the year, and the first time I wasn't alone. My friend Michelle joined me for this trip. She and I have been hiking together for at least 10 years. We've put in a lot of miles together. We hadn't been able to get out recently, so it was a joy to get a whole weekend together.\u00a0We set up camp slowly, then made a snack and poured a drink. Then we lounged with our backs against a log and stared at the waves. We talked, we gossiped, we complained, we laughed. I've loved my solo trips, but it also felt amazing to have so much time to just be with my friend. After a long period of lazy lounging, we wandered down the beach. We enjoyed looking at the tracks of some little sea creature (sand crabs, I believe) that were left all over the beach. We walked as far south as the tide would let us, then returned to camp.\u00a0We made dinner and started a small fire. (Fires are allowed on the beach, according to the ranger I spoke to. Only use small driftwood, and don't take any wood from the forest. It was easy to find plenty of small driftwood appropriate for a small fire.\u00a0He suggested making a fire below the high tide mark so it simply washed away later. Clever.)Having a fire was a special treat, because it's rare fires are appropriate on my backpacking trips. I especially appreciated it after a short but heavy rainstorm got me rather wet.\u00a0(Note to self: When it starts raining, but on raincoat first. Then stash gear under tent's rainfly. If you do it in the opposite order you get rather wet.)While we were eating dinner, we looked up to see a bald eagle sitting on the beach not far away.\u00a0We went to bed at dark and both were asleep quickly. The sound of the waves was very soothing.\u00a0Next morning we\u00a0woke up as the sun was rising. It turned out to be a lovely sunny day, and we packed up and hiked out in the sun.\u00a0I'd love to bring my family back here for a trip later this year. My daughter would love the beach and my husband would love the ability to bring all the luxuries he wants. (I once backpacked on the Olympic Coast near a group that had carried in bocce ball. I draw the line at bocce ball. Even if it was pretty fun\u2014our neighbors let us play. But some camp chairs, beach toys, a frisbee and extra heavy food, that sounds great.)\u00a0", "date": "Mar 17, 2018"}, {"comment": "Beautiful weekend for an overnight at Second Beach!

"comments":[{"comment": "We decided to make an early season excursion into the Enchantments. We started at the Snow Lakes trailhead just outside of Leavenworth.The\u00a0start of the trail was muddy and sometimes with running water down it.\u00a0Around a mile in, it had patches of snow which soon because larger deeper patches between dry ground. Eventually, it got annoying enough to put on our snowshoes, although we were walking on dry ground for a bit in them. Finally, it became completely snowed over. There were quite a few downed trees which were very awkward to climb over with snowshoes.The trail became fairly obscured as we approached the first switchbacks, so we broke trail the entire trip.Eventually, we came up an avalanche chute with large amounts of old debris. Because we hit it earlier in the morning, it was very hard. We pulled out or ice axes and carefully crossed it while wearing our mountaineering snowshoes. It was a fairly short traverse, so we put our ice axes away.The trek up to Nada Lake was fairly straightforward. There was one bridge which had a fairly thin rim of snow on it, just about big enough for a single snowshoe. You could cross it carefully, but if you fell in, you would mostly be hurt from the fall. The creek was only a few inches deep. I'm sure you could find a snow bridge to cross if you didn't like the bridge.Nada Lake was completely frozen over and quite pretty. We then proceeded to go to Snow Lakes. We hit the traverse where the switchbacks would normally be. The snow had softened quite a bit. It was the consistency of a snowcone. We saw some signs of loose wet releases on the slope to the east, but the snow on the switchbacks was well bonded. Despite stomping on it pretty hard, we could only trigger small pinwheels that quickly stopped.\u00a0It was hard breaking trail through that rotten snow, but we managed.Eventually, we made it up to Snow Lakes and set up camp between the upper and lower lakes.That night, it was very windy. We could hear the wind howling, but we were camped in the trees and almost entirely sheltered. It rained a bit, and the temperature oscillated between quite warm requiring me to unzip my sleeping bag and below freezing.We woke up the next morning to head up to Lake Viviane.\u00a0The bridge over Snow Creek looked a bit sketchy with loose snow on it, but we easily found a snow bridge to cross. There was no trail up there except for faint old snowshoe tracks, but we navigated up and around some small cliffs. It wasn't too hard as long as you kept the creek to your left.We eventually hit the steep traverse up to the lake. We initially climbed up in our snowshoes using poles as the snow was somewhat soft. We hit another patch of avalanche debris, and the snow became quite a bit harder. We then pulled out our ice axes and kicked steps (snowshoes on) all the way up. It was exhausting. In retrospect, it would have been easier if we just did it in boots.At the top, we had a spectacular view of Lake Viviane, Temple Lake, and all of the surrounding peaks. We ate lunch up there, but hurried down because it was very windy.At that point, the snow had melted out quite a bit, and the descent down the slope was on softer snow, and our ice axes would only get grip if you plunged them down all the way.\u00a0We thought it was soft enough to let us slide and self arrest without the axe, but hard enough that we may slide into a rock first. We then decided to downclimb the slope using the axes as belays. Eventually, the slope became mellower and we plunge stepped with our snowshoes all the way down. We saw a steady stream of backcountry skiers headed into the core.The route back to the lake was uneventful. We ran into two cross country skiers who warned us against the traverse between Snow Lakes and Nada. They saw several spontaneous loose wet avalanches.We headed back to camp and decided to wake up early the next day to get out, as the snow had destabilized quite a bit. In the morning, we hit the traverse between Snow Lakes and Nada which was releasing the day prior.\u00a0We ran into some skin tracks, and the snow was still very hard. We removed our snowshoes and put on crampons to start the traverse. The crampons got a good bite, but the snow was so hard and icy that we couldn't get any purchase with the spikes of our axes. We could get our picks in. Eventually, the became uneven enough that we began chopping steps. It became very apparent that this was way too sketchy, so we turned around and carefully descended to a protected rocky area to figure out what to do. We saw some skin tracks about 50 feet below.As we descended, we noticed that the snow near the rocky area was quite a bit softer, and sometimes really postholey. We then decided to downclimb close to the rocks and trees using our axes as belays. We couldn't get too close to the rocks\u00a0or else we would posthole through. We safely made it down. In retrospect, we probably should not have followed the\u00a0 hard-packed skin tracks and descended lower down either front pointing or face down.We safely made it down and to Nada Lake. We snowshoed across Nada Lake. It was a quick descent to the switchbacks to the trailhead. The avalanche\u00a0debris we had encountered the first day had softened enough that we just walked across it with our snowshoes.The trail then became a mess of soft snow, and we trudged downward. Once we hit dry ground, we ran into a group of teenagers in shorts and tennis shoes who asked how\u00a0long it would take to get to Snow Lakes. We informed them that the trail was completely snowed over, and they responded, \"How can there be snow if it's clear skies?\" We told them they could not possibly make it, but they kept on going. I'm sure they turned around once serious snow happened.We descended what seemed to be forever switchbacks to the car and headed into Leavenworth for some food. I then found a fairly large tick stuck to the back of my head. Apparently, it is tick season now.We drove back over Steven's Pass.

The parking lot was full but that was to be expected with so few low level options available in the area outside Portland and this being the closest one.The wide dirt trail was relatively steep in the beginning as we climbed past the lower falls, pausing only to take a few pictures at the water cascading down 250 feet over the lime green lichen splattered basalt rock so common in the this area.\u00a0 We had read on the kiosk at the trailhead about the families that once owned this property and I wondered what it would have been like to have such grandeur in one's backyard.\u00a0 The changing view as we neared the top allowed us to look behind the waterfall with the Columbia River in the background.After passing the falls, the trail leveled out slightly as it followed the creek and there were several wooden bridges as we crossed back and forth on our ascent. We walked past moss covered trees and glossy ground cover until reaching the upper falls just under a mile from the car.\u00a0 This waterfall was a unique sight as it starts out with a wide fan flowing over the wall for about 20 feet but then it hit another wall that sticks out in front of it like an arm unsuccessfully holding it back which then causes the water to change course and come down more as a chute in front of a gaping, toothy grin of rock.\u00a0We didn't stay long as the spray is quite drenching but made our way over the bridge in front of the waterfall and back down the trail as it followed the creek on the west side.\u00a0 This second part of the loop was more forested and further back and had us come out just a bit west of the trailhead and onto the highway. \u00a0We learned that the work is slowing making its way east as they clear the historic highway but that the devastation to the trails is vast.\u00a0 We had stopped at the trailhead for Angel's Rest to read the signs and the police tape and wording that says that they, SAR and the sheriff's department will not come get you if you ignore the closed trail signs due to hazardous conditions.\u00a0 That was good enough for us...\u00a0", "date": "Jan 8, 2018"}, {"comment": "Beautiful bike with multiple wild flowers.

Even during this summer time, all waterfalls were very nice to see with good volume of water.Parking: We reached the multnomah trail head around 7.00 AM and there were only 4 or 5 other cars with plenty of parking available. When we got back around 11.30 AM the parking was overflowing with cars waiting along the road to find a spot.Trail conditions: The trail is heavily used and in a great state. The stretch from Multnomah falls to top of falls and the final 1.5 miles were paved.Shade: All of the hike is well shaded in thick woods, I don't think we had to use any hat or sun screen.Elevation gain: The trail gains elevation very gradually with numbered switch backs till the top of Multnomah falls. After this point the elevation gain continues to be gradual, but not many switch backs. After crossing Wahkeena springs junction, the trail starts going downhill - I felt the drop was much steeper than climbing from Multnomah trail head (trail map linked below)Route: We started the hike from the Multnomah falls trail head upto the junction to Larch mountain. At this point, we kept right at fork and reached Wahkeena springs junction and then started hiking toward Fairy falls, Lemmon's viewpoint and Wahkeena falls. All the waterfalls were amazing - most of the folks stop at Multnomah falls overlook. So, when we reached Ecola/Weisendanger falls there was no one else in the trail and was really quite to enjoy the views. Fairy falls was really beautiful like a veil over the rocks and was great subject for taking long exposure shots.https://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/stelprdb5227099.pdf", "date": "Aug 20, 2017"}, {"comment": "This Waterfall is extremely popular, I would suggest going on a week day and very early to avoid the massive amounts of people.

Just be aware that I-84 is super icy and has strong gusts of wind. With the wind chill factor and the amount of ice, it was very cold to say the least. We had the kids bundled and then some. It was A clear 23 degrees and since the sun was south of us, the falls didn't see much light, making it extremely cold. The worst part was getting from the parking lot to the lodge/rec area. it was so windy, people were sliding on the ice and falling. Once we made it to the base, we found they had the gate closed, which accessed the popular bridge everyone enjoys walking across. So, everyone simply climbed around the gate to go up the trail despite the warnings of ice. The trail to the bridge was not that bad. There was a 50 foot section of the trail which was super narrow and icy. It was too narrow to allow traffic in both directions so we had to take turns. There were people braving the remainder of the trail to the top but it proved too icy and treacherous to take our kids up. Going down the trail was the real challenge. Make sure you plan ahead and be prepared for the wind chill !  Other than the conditions, the falls never disappoint ! Cheers !", "date": "Jan 15, 2017"}],

We got into the snow about a quarter mile from the trailhead. When we started hiking the snow was really patchy. As we began to get closer to the lake the snow got deeper and the patches got more frequent and eventually it turned into solid snow. By this point we were regretting not bringing our snowshoes but decided to gut it out and see how far we could get. As we approached a rock outcropping a few miles from the lake the trees started to clear up and the snow got EXTREMELY deep from about mid thigh to your belly button. At this point a few members of my group were beginning to get cold and wet. So we called it a day and decided to stop and set up camp as it was dark. After dinner we hit the hay. Around 9pm it started to pour down rain which wasn't really a surprise as there was a 80% chance of rain that weekend. It rained all night but we were lucky it had stopped by morning. We packed up our gear and headed back to the vehicles by 7am. It was a bit of a sluggish walk out for all of the snow had gotten kind of slushy, but on the bright side the snow was about 4 inches shallower. Once we arrived back at the trailhead we found that there was no longer any snow at the trailhead and there was a decent amount of hikers getting ready to begin there hike. Overall this hike was a lot of fun the trail was easy to navigate. We never made it to the lake but I can say if you plan on hiking to Packwood lake bring snowshoes!!

This is the earliest in the year I've ever hiked it. The parking lot was empty. 3 Cars counting mine. The weather was excellent, sunny and no snow at trailhead. The temperature was in the high 40's and low 50's. Perfect. I ran into snow about 2 miles from the lake and spotty in the beginning. It was steady snow around 1.5 miles from the lake and oddly enough...the last 1/8 mile was virtually snow free. The snow was about 1-2 feet deep and well tracked. Pretty crunchy so you didn't sink or get too wet. Beautiful though. No snow at the lake but a thin layer of ice over top that made beautiful breaking sounds with the wind. One the best times to go. I had the lake to myself and easy travel even in the snow. It's still early. Not sure the amount of snow after this weekend. Snow or not...a must do.", "date": "Jan 14, 2018"}, {"comment": "We went looking for an easily accessible hike with the possibility of snowshoeing and found lovely Packwood Lake, 9+ roundtrip miles of rolling trail and beautiful forest.The road to the trailhead had some ice in places but plenty of bare pavement. There is a slide perhaps two miles from the trailhead that is easy to get around. When we arrived there was only one other car in the parking lot.The trail is in great condition, sidehilling through the forest for a couple of miles to the Goat Rocks Wilderness boundary sign. It may as well have been a \"snow beyond this point\" sign, though, because while there were a few minor patches before the wilderness, once inside it was pretty much nonstop snow travel. Of course we'd left our snowshoes in the car, but the trail was pretty well packed and we had no problem wearing trail running shoes (me) and sneakers (whoops, forgot the boots at home). Poles, as always, really helped.When we arrived at the lake we met the other folks on the trail and made some new friends, trading hiking stories and munching on snacks. We wandered over the bridge to look at the dam and the historic 1910 Forest Service ranger cabin, which alone is worth the hike. Our friends told us the lake is very busy during the summer. Given the easy hike in and the beautiful setting, that's no surprise; a shoulder-season overnight would be a lot of fun.We donned micro spikes for the hike out and boy, was that ever a good idea. Since the snow wasn't deep, postholing wasn't a problem, and the spikes added great traction that made the hike out much faster. We past a larger party heading in (hope they had headlamps), and that was the entire hiking population on the Packwood Lake trail--about ten people all day, including us. If you're looking for an easy leg-stretcher in the off-season, check this one out. And look for elk in the lowlands. We saw at least 50 on Highway 12.", "date": "Jan 6, 2018"}],

You have to hike 10 miles of road just to access the official Olympic Hot Springs Trailhead. A little over a mile in, the road is washed out and uncrossable (deep water). There are several reroutes around the washout. The first is a ~1/4 a mile before the bridge on the Elwha River Trail. Second is right before crossing bridge, though route is rough (steep/flooded/not official trail). The third reroute, the option we did, is a log crossing on the left, in between bridge and road washout. There are red/pink flags marking routes, but these can be confusing. May be difficult with heavy bikes, but doable if you\u2019re adventurous. There were cyclists who did it while we were there. Past the reroute, the road is gradual up to the old Elwha dam. Beyond that it gets steeper and winding, with lots of trees and debris to cross over/around. When you reach the official Trailhead, the snow goes from a couple inches to up to 12\u2019 deep in areas. Hot springs are filled with green algae, and the first 4-5 are Luke warm and shallow (less than knee deep). Get there early to get the deeper pools hidden up off the main trail.

The alternative route is easy, but a little muddy. It follows the river mostly, but there are multiple routes (it seems like they all lead to the same place); generally there are laminated signs around showing that you are still on the trail.\u00a0The road follows the Elwha ranger station and the Glines Canyon Overlook (super cool).\u00a0 Then the road gets really steep and has lots of trees and fallen branches on it.\u00a0 Then you get to the official Hot springs trail head (also the TH for appleton pass and the hot springs).

We almost couldn't find the trail to the hot springs in the snow. We followed signs in the snow for \"HOT\" and a penis drawing. It led us correctly. The hot springs were hot like a hot tub and we stayed in for thirty minutes. They are all various shapes/sizes/depths/conditions. The hot springs were all covered in dark green bacteria. We aren't sure what this was exactly, but it seemed safe enough?Crystal Creek water is real tasty. There was no information about the water source contamination on the boards at the TH or down by the closed Elwha Ranger Station. We boiled the water just in case.\u00a0Hot spring safety tips: Don't put your head under water. try not to touch the bacteria that is in the streams coming out of the hot springs (the heat of the springs are probably not killing the ones that can inhabit skin temperature), try not to stir up the dirt at bottom of pool. If you're planning on going, consult the internet/doctor/microbiologist/etc. We weren't sure before we went so we just kind of guessed based on our knowledge of microbes and we're okay so far.\u00a0", "date": "Mar 21, 2018"}, {"comment": "tldr: There is a temporary access trail that gets you around the washout!

Bikes or wheeled vehicles are allowed on the road, but not the temporary access trail or the hot springs trail.\u00a0I left at about 11:45am from the parking lot where you can drive up to and didn't get to the hot springs until nightfall. Sign on the closed gate says it is 10.9 miles from that location to the hot springs, but you can use wheel vehicles if you like on the road. Someone had a fat tire bike and there were some bike trails in the snow going up to the trailhead. If you do that, there are a lot of logs down across the road and you would have to lift the bike over some of them and technically carry your bike on the bypass trail or try to ford the washout with it. Eek! I don't know how they got past the washout!\u00a0I just parked my car there and walked the mostly two lane paved road to the trailhead. I dropped my envelope at the Elwha Ranger Station along the way to the Hot Springs. The ranger at the Port Angeles Wilderness Information Center didn't even know if there would be envelopes up there! Before the washout they have now built a new trail that is well marked on the way out and was a little tricky on the way back at night for me. Follow the yellow ribbons. I don't know how I got lost, but I follow the pink and white flags accidentally on the way back and had to scramble up an eroding cliff to get back up to the trail!

The log bridges are slippery, but they have handrails. The hot springs were lukewarm or even\u00a0cool at some points probably due to the heavy rains. There is a huge fallen tree before one of the hot springs that I fell trying to get around and then just\u00a0crawled under it on the way back.I got so wet (it was raining, misting, or snowing the whole time) I ended up doing a 22 mile hike instead of an overnight because I needed to keep moving to stay warm.

The road was snow-free from the junction with Highway 101 until the resort, but the final two miles from the resort to the trailhead had a thin layer of snow/ice. The parking lot at the end of the road had a modest amount of snow, but it was mostly plowed clear. The privys at the trailhead were well-stocked with paper and sanitizer.\u00a0To Sol Duc Falls: A bit of snow and ice on the trail, but no microspikes needed. The falls have excellent volume and are a sight to behold.Up to Deer Lake: There's a small blow-down by the junction to Deer Lake, but it's easily navigated. You won't need snowshoes until maybe half a mile up, but then you'll really need them. There's several feet of powder at times, interspersed with small creeks caused by melt-off.\u00a0We had to do some step-kicking at times to cross three-foot deep rivulets, which caused us to ascend a bit more slowly than I anticipated. The only truly dicey portion of the trip is the final approach to the lake, where there's a steep drop off to the left.Heading\u00a0Down:\u00a0The lake itself is placid and a bit unremarkable, almost entirely frozen over. We made good time on the way down, and around halfway ran into an ill-prepared hiking party in jeans that did not have snowshoes. They had been postholing up the whole way, and looked less than thrilled. Also, the amount of snow melting and falling from the tree canopy\u00a0was\u00a0visually stunning, and physically too: I got a few hard knocks on the head from plummeting clods of ice.Bonus: The hot springs at the resort make for a nice soak!

Very lush, green and humid - gotta love rainforests! Smoke from the wildfires was still noticeable, but not bothersome. There were more backpackers than day-hikers on the trail.

About 4.5 miles from the Sol Duc parking lot to the junction with Appleton Pass. \u00a0Appleton Pass: Brutal 2,500-ish ft push, especially with a full pack and in such hot and humid weather as we had - but oh, so worth it.\u00a0 The pass is absolutely stunning, even minus the clear 360 degree views.\u00a0 Wildflowers in full bloom right now.\u00a0 A dozen or so established sites up there, with the best by far being the one we snagged high up on the ridge above Oyster \"Lake\", with its own water source.\u00a0 *A note here about proper Leave No Trace principles: If, upon reaching said epic site, it is already occupied, please, under no circumstances, decide to plop down your three tents in the meadow adjacent to it.\u00a0 Besides being incredibly rude (most of us doing this type of thing are trying to get away from groups of other people, and would like some solitude as a reward for all of our hard work), there is absolutely no cause to trample fragile meadow in order to get the \"best\" views - especially when there are half a dozen or so already-established sites readily available, one of which is located not twenty steps away from where you've decided to improperly place yourselves.* Sigh. Appleton Pass Waytrail/Cat Basin Primitive Trail: Oy.\u00a0 Ouch.\u00a0 Obstacles.\u00a0 I'm out of O words.\u00a0 These trails are primitive indeed; they require bushwacking, branch hopping, scrambling, and fortitude.\u00a0 There's steep, and then more steep, and loose footing, and three separate passes to get over.\u00a0 In such brutally dry and oppressive heat as we had this weekend (the wildfire smoke kept everything very close-feeling), it was rough.\u00a0 That being said, absolutely gorgeous, epic views that must be just jaw-dropping when you can see fully Olympus and Carrie and Cat - it was stunning enough with the limited views we had and the crazy profusion of wildflowers along the way.\u00a0 But the trails are often hard to find and follow (just keep gazing at the horizon until you find them again), and definitely hard underfoot.\u00a0 Bring water, and be prepared.\u00a0 Coming up out of the final pass to find sweet little Swimming Bear Lake was a real treat - as was the cold plunge we took to refresh and reinvigorate for the push to Cat Basin.Cat Basin: Never did find the elusive \"ridge sites\" that the ranger told us to look for - everything we found here was not a proper LNT site, being on grass or meadow.\u00a0 Maybe that's the expectation, but it didn't feel good to do so, so we ended up staying in the stock camp - which, aside from the voracious flies and mosquitos, was sweet and lovely, with yet more wildflowers and a flowing creek for water.\u00a0 That being said, it's a climb down and then back up and out of Cat Basin, so unless absolutely necessary (or somehow on the way for your particular trip), it's probably not a destination worthy of a trip in and of itself.\u00a0 Saw three bears happily munching away on the huckleberries\u00a0 on the hillside above us all morning long, one of which had tried to enter our meadow the night before, but luckily paid attention and moved along when the other party in the basin with us began yelling at him to \"Go away bear!\u00a0 No - the other way\"!!High Divide: Awesome trail, gorgeous views, wildflowers galore.\u00a0 No water source between Heart Lake and Deer Lake, so come prepared.\u00a0 Only a few campsites along the way here, so get good advice from a ranger and try to leave early if you want to snag one. \u00a0 When you come to the junction for the Seven Lakes Basin, there's a great overlook down into the lakes not 300 feet up that trail.Deer Lake: Sweet place to stop for fuel and water and use the loo.\u00a0 A welcome respite from the heat and dryness of the rest of the trail, and as a place to gather strength for the final four miles back to the trailhead.Bugs were absolutely atrocious - they were completely impervious to both our Permethrined clothing and generously applied bug spray.\u00a0 Biting flies (huge ones that apparently have been feasting on anything and everything for quite some time) and hordes of mosquitos that liked to fly up noses, into mouths, and land on eyelids.\u00a0Busy trails on a weekend - the only time we had solitude was when we were on the Cat Basin Primitive trail.\u00a0 Come prepared for that, too.\u00a0", "date": "Aug 5, 2017"}, {"comment": "I originally wanted to attempt an overnight at Lunch Lake with Deer Lake as a backup, but I could not find much information on conditions (beyond snow covered) so I stuck with Deer Lake and decided to scout the rest. \u00a0NPS advertised 2 snow free campsites but I found at least 4, which was surprising since the conditions are pretty soggy in places from all the snow melt. \u00a0Spent a nice evening and then had a late start continuing up High Divide (which I would soon regret...). \u00a0The trail is completely snow covered 1 mile up from Deer Lake, but it was gorgeous and the little ponds are starting to melt out. \u00a0Continued on up the ridge and I was glad to have my ice axe, although there were some places on the ridge itself where the trail was melted out! \u00a0Half followed ridgeline trail/half followed the ridge itself, but things got really interesting around 4745ft. \u00a0The going was tough on the snow, and the trail I did find was very overgrown and difficult to follow, so not sure if that was an older trail or the actual trail that needs a bit TLC. \u00a0However, once I finally crested more or less with the trail, the trial continued on and was mostly melted out up as far as I could see heading out to Lunch Lake and Bogachiel Peak, but I had regretfully reached my time limit at this point (next time setting an alarm!). \u00a0I had my crampons with me but travel in my boots was easy enough. \u00a0However, this route will definitely require an ice axe (with the skill of how to use it!) for a few more weeks.", "date": "Jun 22, 2017"}],

We certainly were. Alone the whole time, from the moment we parked the car till we came back.\r The price to pay (and the reason for the solitude) is some serious bushwhacking that you will have to do. My fairly big survival knife was no match for the overgrowth. Put on long pants and long sleeves, at least I would the second time round. I'm a bit scraped up right now. But if you are already on the trail with less clothing than that, you will survive. If you think you lost the trail, spread the branches, and look low. We did get lost on the way back on a weird \"Y\" trail branch, and then started carefully backtracking with one of us staying behind as a reference point, and the other trying to find what was certainly the trail. To avoid freaking out, having a good GPS or a phone map is a good idea (and the battery fully charged, because we were using the hell out of it).\r Another tough part is finding the trail in the first place. The coordinates shown on the main page are pretty good. And yet we missed the spot, partly because we were looking for a more obvious larger trailhead. There is a sign on the west side of the NF-5484 that we took a picture of and attached to this report, so you know what to look for. There is a little parking area opposite to the east, where 2-3 cars would fit (but there will probably be none, which is why it is hard to find it)\r The total length appears to be 1.25 mile, if you go by what the signs tell you (3/4 to the Pacific Crest Trail - PCT, and 1/2 mile thereafter). The climb is gentle, you probably gain less than a few hundred feet.\r Another possibility to get there is from PCT.

Flowers are blooming under the chair lifts on the way the Beaver Lake. The wind was blowing cold as I hiked along. I passed the side trail to Lodge Lake and continue south on a section of the PCT I had not hiked in the past. I found the old junction to the trail that once went down hill from Lodge Lake to the former Denny Creek Ranger Station. I'll do a separate report on the old trail. Hiking south the PCT turns into a really nice trail through the old growth forest. I came across a Forest Service sign reading, \"Snoqualmie Pass 2 1/2 Miles, Stampede Pass 16 Miles\". Further on the trail comes out on a over grown road with a view to the west with I-90 down below. Granite Mtn., Bandera and McCellan Butte can be seen. The trail leaves the road, then heads down hill and crosses a large boulder field with more views. The trail crosses over Rockdale Creek on some boulders. I went about 1/4 mile passed the creek before turning around for the hike back. A few parts of the PCT are getting brushy. Did not see any animals on the trip and only a few other hikers as I hiked back to Snoqualmie Pass. George", "date": "Jul 18, 2013"}],

Many people get to Mirror lake via Cottonwood which is a shorter hike but a longer drive, and they miss a very pretty section of the PCT. Today, the temperature was 35 at the trailhead, and we saw plenty of frost along the trail; the ponds had a pretty layer of ice crystals on them. This is a mostly shady hike with some sunny spots and views. We did find a sunny spot at the lake. Saw about 6 other hikers altogether, at least one headed to Silver Peak, two doing the same route we did, and two who came up the short way to Mirror.", "date": "Oct 11, 2016"}, {"comment": "My daughter and I hiked from Windy Pass to Mirror Lake and back--6 miles total--on Saturday, July 30. The trail head is at the point where the Pacific Crest Trail crosses Forest Service Road 9070, approximately 5 miles from Exit 54 (Hyak). The trail is well-maintained, mostly through forest, crossing a few rock slides, passing a few ponds here and there. The flowers plentiful right now, especially the bear grass, but also subalpine spirea, goats beard, sitka valerian, broadleaf arnica, lupine, columbine, pentsemon, tiger lily, queens cup, strawberry, cascade azalea, thimbleberry. The trillium, salmonberry, vanilla leaf, and plentiful marsh marigold have already bloomed. Mirror Lake is beautiful, with good campsites, though most (or possibly all) were occupied. (As day hikers, we didn't scope it out carefully.) There was a fair amount of traffic on the trail, but it didn't feel overcrowded. This is an excellent beginner hike for kids--not too strenuous, and not a ton of elevation change. Also good for stretching your legs to begin the season.", "date": "Jul 30, 2016"}, {"comment": "I was getting out on a hike with my Dad, who hasn't been hiking yet this year. We wanted a close to Seattle hike as he had already driven up from Olympia. I chose Mirror Lake on the Pacific Crest Trail south of Snoqualmie Pass. I opted to start at Windy Pass and hike south to Mirror Lake. This was a great option and actually surprisingly great hike to a beautiful aquamarine lake. Going via the PCT gives you a six mile round trip hike. The road to Windy Pass is in decent condition, however low clearance cars will have a difficult time in a handful of places due to water erosion from streams flowing over the road during heavy rains. My Subraru Forester did fine, we just took it slow (like everyone else). Right before Windy Pass, water has worn down the road, exposing large rocks. If you're uncomfortable driving your car over it up to the pass, there's a little pull out right before. The trail is in good shape. There are a few trees down across the trail, but nothing impassable. In one spot a few trees with some remaining snow stuck underneath means heading off the trail a little and then back up. That's the worst spot. Some mosquitoes are out, but nothing too terrible. The trailhead was actually the worst spot (why is that always the case?). Creeks are flowing and the ponds along the way are still looking mostly fresh. Bear grass is in bloom. Mirror Lake itself is very pretty for a lower elevation lake. It has that nice blue green color and Tinkham Peak towers above with some green meadows. It was a pleasant destination and a good place to eat lunch. There were a number of people camped near the outlet. It looks like there's about three or four campsites at that end of the lake (we did not hike down there to confirm though). We stopped at a place that would make a better day use area, but it looks like people camp there too. Spot for one tent on sloping ground. Other than that, we saw one more campsite at the other end of the lake below Tinkham. So there's a few options. There are a few different ways to reach Mirror Lake. Going via the PCT is a great way to do it. If you have time, you could always drop down 1/2 a mile to Cottonwood Lake to explore. There's also a little loop option that I think quite a few folks do as well.", "date": "Jul 23, 2016"}, {"comment": "It does take 1.75 hours from Seattle to reach the Windy Pass trailhead south of Snoqualmie Pass. The final 5 miles of the drive is one pot hole after another. We hiked only to Mirror Lake but the reporting system does not allow that description. We started hiking at 10:30. There were not too many cars in the parking lot. Surprisingly enough, there are several side trails off the PCT which is where some hikers must have gone. While we did not have the trail to ourselves, it certainly was not crowded. There was a light drizzle of rain almost the entire hike to Mirror Lakes, with heavy showers once or twice. By the time we reached the lake it was cold and wet. We ate our lunches standing up, then started the return trip. This is a fairly easy hike along the PCT and there was only one significant blow down which was easy to hike around. Thank you to the recent work party who sawed through the many downed trees earlier in the week. While you are rarely if ever above the tree line, this is a good hike. Mirror Lake would have been fun except for the rain. By the time we reached the parking lot at the trail head the sun had finally decided to shine.", "date": "Jul 3, 2016"}, {"comment": "I just wanted to add to the previous trip report about trail conditions south of Windy Pass. I was out with the PCTA work party and we were clearing trees and debris both a few miles north and south of Stampede Pass in addition to the work closer to Snoqualmie Pass. We made great progress but there are still trees to be cut, hopefully in the next few weeks. The road to Stampede Pass had plenty of potholes and a few significant runoff ruts that will definitely slow low clearance vehicles down. There are still some patches of snow on the trail but nothing major until you get up above 4100' which is pretty typical right now in the Cascades. It's melting fast, though!", "date": "Jun 5, 2016"}],

If you take the left fork, as I did, you'll come across several places where you can turn right and follow elk trails or an abandoned road toward Gracie, but most of them reconnect with the trail that I just described forking to the right. If you go a bit further on the left fork, the abandoned road curves to the left and looks like it's going in the completely wrong direction from Gracie, but once you cross an abandoned fence line you'll find a way to go to the right and up along a long gentle ridge line to Gracie.Hope that makes sense.

If it were named anything other than \"Lookout Mountain\" I think it would be more popular, because there just isn't much of a lookout. At best, you'd get a partial view of Lake Whatcom from the top, but the surrounding trees are pretty high and obscure the view. Lovely trail, great forest, just not a lookout.Please leash your dogs. It is clearly marked on-leash, yet we ran into two dogs off-leash. For one, it's the law and ignoring that because \"your dog is nice\" is rude to other dog owners who keep their dogs leashed. It's also safer for your dog, as there are frequent bear and cougar sightings out there. I picked up as much poop as I could with my extra bags, but there were plenty of piles along the trail.

Coming back we saw only about 5 people on trail. I will try my best to explain the trail from what I remember for those that have never been here before. So you will park at end of the road at a gate. You'll just go around it. The trail you'll be on is gravel-like and you'll pass these ponds. The trail will curve to the right but you'll see a small trail veering to the left. I have no idea what goes to the left but we stayed on the main trail. Like other trip reports have said, follow the ribbons and also the spray painted signs directing to falls. One thing I almost missed was the big log jam on your LEFT. Good thing my husband noticed that the log jam had a spray painted symbol on it so we went around the log jam, then down to a small creek and up the hill. Then we encountered another gate that says something like \"This way to falls\". Eventually you'll see the falls through the trees and there is a trail that veers right to get to the falls. If you want a closer look, there's an easy stream to cross to get closer. Hope this helps. It was very pretty up close. The pictures don't do it justice but the falls were bigger than I expected.

I had first viewed the falls 50 years ago way back in 1968. Back then you could drive up the Echo Lake Trail Trail Road to the falls from the Monroe Camp Road. The last time I was to the falls and the trail above it was 20 years ago. I parked at the gated Monroe Camp Road where there is space for several cars. It is a road walk to get to the falls. The first 1/2 mile is on crushed rock and the rest of the way is on a decommissioned DNR road where the culverts have been removed. So you get the go through several tank traps, one is a big one. When I got to the falls I crossed a unnamed fork of the East Fork of Woods Creek. The trail up to the top of the falls is the steepest part of the hike. Once near the top of the falls I took the right fork of the trail and headed upstream along the creek. In a short distance I crossed the creek a second time with some rock hops. The trail continues up hill through the second growth forest. I came to an old logging railroad grade once used by the Monroe Logging Company. They logged 4,400 acres of timberland acquired from the Northern Pacific Railroad in the Lake Roesiger area from 1922 to 1947. After crossing the grade the trail heads up to the ridge line with several switchbacks, then follows the ridge to where the trail comes out at a DNR reprod area with 20' tall Doug Firs. I continued up the trail to a fork. The left trail was over grown, while the right one was brushed out. In about 150 yards I come to an old DNR Road where I saw an old log pole shelter that had fallen down. I went up the road for about a 1/2 mile, then decided to turn around at a spot where I had a view out to the west. I hiked back down the the old shelter and had lunch, After eating I headed back down the Explorer Ridge Trail to the old railroad grade. I checked out the grade and found two old camp sites. Then is was back down the trail to the falls and the road walk back to the gate.The best trail to hike on was the one going up to the ridge from the old logging railroad grade. Trekking poles a handy for the steep sections of the trail and the creek crossings. Since the road walk is only about a mile, adding on the trail above the falls gives you a longer hike. Only saw two other hikers all day, down at the falls on my way back. I did not include a photo of the falls, since most of the old trip reports have one. Note that WTA has the Explorer Falls hike listed under, \"Mtn. Loop Highway\". It is off the East Lake Roesiger Road, then the Monroe Camp Road, no where near the Mtn. Loop Highway. In the previous 78 WTA trip reports for this hike, no one mentioned the trail going up to the ridge high above the falls. Check it out. George", "date": "Mar 19, 2018"}],

Water is a bit sparse, but I suspect there will be more soon with recent rains. The longest water-free section was north of Holman Pass. Just past the pass, there is a stream. Get water at it. The next water is Hopkins Lake, 9 miles farther. \r There's also a long stretch without water just south of Harts Pass. After leaving Brush Creek (northbound), the next water is after Grasshopper Pass. After you descend from the pass, look for a camp on your right. Go through the camp and look downhill. A small trail leads down to a very green area with a huge boulder. You can't see the water until you get near it. It's an absolutely gorgeous spot to get water. \r If you use the Halfmile PCT app, all of the seasonal streams it mentions were flowing.  \r I spent the first night at Snowy Lakes, which is about half a mile off of the PCT. I missed the trail the first time I walked by. It's to the right (as you're heading north.) Look for a large meadow and a vertical pole that's partially broken off.

Pretty good for such a busy place.\r A few other notes:\r * There is a nice bear box at the camp 5 miles from the end of the trail. It's bear proof. It's NOT mouse proof. And the mice like chocolate. \r* Grasshopper Pass seems like it would be a great day trip from Harts Pass. Lovely scenery and lots of larches.\r* There are very few blowdowns. There's one huge one just past Methow River that took a bit of work to get over. All the others were easy to navigate. Most of the blowdowns were just before the Canadian border (going northbound.) \r* If you are backpacking the PCT, you can drop the trash from your trip at Harts Pass. (Or you could when I passed by.) Look for the sign on the outhouse door for info. \r* Trail crews did work on the tread where the trail had become narrow and was sloughing. The trail looks great now. Overall, the trail is in great condition.", "date": "Aug 28, 2016"}, {"comment": "I ran behind the racers of the Cutthroat Classic, point-to-point from the Rainy Pass trailhead off state highway 20 to the Cutthroat Lake trailhead on state highway 20, then hitched a ride back up to my truck.  I believe that ~350 trail runners made the race.  From Rainy Pass, the trail climbs steadily towards Cutthroat Pass (~5 miles from the trailhead), then has a handful of switchbacks that bring you to the pass.  Views for the last 2 miles of this section are spectacular, though water sources are few and small after Porcupine Creek.  From here, I took the steep descent towards the Cutthroat Lake trailhead, which switch backs for about 4 miles, and then is a steady descent for the final two.  \r Some major clearing had been done from Rainy Pass towards Cutthroat Pass.  I was surprised at how little an impact some 350 pairs of feet had done to the trail, which was in good shape, but noticed some trash that the runners had surely generated (especially after the aid station). Swedish fish, GU packets, and little paper cups littered the trail.", "date": "Aug 27, 2016"}],

Heading in, the road leading to the trail head/Elwha Ranger Station was a little torn up at spots but it was nothing any normal car couldn't navigate. Just be mindful of the 1 lane bridge halfway and yield to exiting traffic. The trail head itself begins directly behind the ranger station in a small daisy covered flat.\r Initially the first .5 mile up isn't too steep. The trail is also in very good condition at this point. We cleared 2 major trees spanning 3 sections of the trail. From there we hiked to the Rock View lookout point at roughly 1800ft, which I highly recommend you stop at. The view from here is truly wonderful. Looking down you can see what remains of the drained Lake Mills and the upper dam. Looking further out you can see the snow-capped ridges of several mountains. \r After our stop there we hiked another .2 miles up and began more trail work, widening the trail and clearing minor obstructions such as fallen maples, windblown logs and overgrown shrubbery. Then it was time to reach the top. Unfortunately we did not go all the way. Being that it was a WTA work party we had some serious work about .3 miles from the top when we came across 3 more fallen trees on the trail, all roughly 25 inches or more in diameter. After we cleared those it was time to head back down.\r Be wary of the trek back down and don't be fooled. Your knees and shins will surely feel every step. Bring plenty of water. This trail rises considerably given the fact it's under 3 miles. All in all we had a great time, cleared most of the major diversions and widened the trail in spots. If you're looking for a challenging hike with great views of the entire Elwha river basin this is the trail you want.

There was also a creek to cross with *gasp* no man-made bridge over it, and the trail is a dried out creek bed in itself, but if those are problems for you, I don't think you should be going on a 10 mile hike.ALSO we saw elk and GOATS in FEBRUARY, so yay!Can't wait to complete the entire Boundary Trail some day!

The Arboretum is (as always) a fabulous place to visit. The winter garden is about 2 weeks away from prime. The earliest witch hazels are blooming now, with later varieties set to bloom in the upcoming weeks. Several types of Daphne fill the air with sweet fragrance, and a few of the winter camellias and rhododendrons are blooming too. It is well worth walking all the paths and trails, though. Winter is a great time to feel like you've got the place *almost* all to yourself. Also this is when many of the grand old trees show off the framework of their trunks and branch patterns. Some are bold and angular, some are soft and layered, others are amazing contortionists. Most are covered in velvety mosses and lichens.\u00a0The paths are all in great shape, no special footwear required unless one plans on taking some of the smaller footpaths. While most of the trails are either paved or packed gravel, some of the smaller side trails are clay-ish type soil, which can be waterlogged and a bit slick in places. Plenty of benches throughout. Restrooms proper at the Visitor's Center, and porta-potties scattered unobtrusively throughout.\u00a0After lots of oooohing and ahhhing at the Arboretum, we heading across the road to the boardwalks and Foster/Marsh Islands. We had hoped to be lucky enough to catch a glimpse of the otters that trip reporter Lucy had seen yesterday, but alas it was not to be. We did see ducks (wood, mallard, shovelers, buffleheads) cormorants, and mergansers. Surprisingly, there were some swans hanging out under the 520 bridge. Lots of hummingbirds zipping around too. It's such a treat to have such a beautiful green space \"in town\"!\u00a0As a side note, there were quite a few places around the area where one could take advantage of Seattle's bike-share program.

The 3/4 mile walk to the trailhead from the parking area is shaded, but after that it's 90% sun, so bring lots of water! The nice thing about the lack of shade is\u00a0that you have constant mountain views, though it was still too hazy/smokey to see Rainer. I started at 8:30 and only saw 3 other groups and they were all going the opposite direction of me so I had the lookout to myself for over an hour! The views are amazing and\u00a0I love that you can go inside and\u00a0write in the log too.As far as getting there, the WTA directions are on point. It took me about 25 minutes to get to the parking lot from 410, it's almost all loose gravel and occasional potholes but\u00a0I was happy to have my SUV. I'm sure sedans could make it without incident, though everyone in the parking lot had SUVs so I can't speak much to that.Happy hiking!", "date": "Aug 11, 2017"}, {"comment": "The 98-degree day cooled down to 73 as we drove up the forest road, ready for a midweek microadventure. We arrived at the trailhead around 7:15pm to find the parking lot empty. That bode well for our hopes of a look inside the lookout at the top! Note for tiny bladders: There is no toilet facility anywhere on this trail. The last flush toilets you'll encounter (coming from the west) are those in Greenwater. The gas station has an outdoor restroom that requires no key. \ud83d\udc4cThe first .7 miles of the trail are a very gradual, wide gravel road. As my hiking companion said, you could do it in flip-flops while carrying a glass of wine. At the large clearing that marks the end of this section is a killer campsite with (what would've been) stunning views of Rainier (had there been no wildfire smoke), but our sights were set higher. If you're staring at majestic Mt. Rainier from the clearing, the trail up the hill continues behind you and climbs very steadily up a rocky hillside. The switchbacks are short, steep, and in dry weather a little tricky due to loose rocks. But the walk itself is\u00a0beautiful and so worth it. You're hiking up a trail carved right into the side of a rock face, past multicolored lichen. I liked having trekking poles for this section (but I also had a 25-pound pack on).Other trip reports give the impression that the switchbacks are impossibly grueling; I found they were challenging enough that I felt accomplished but short enough that I wasn't completely taxed, and they were over before I knew it. The hike isn't\u00a0done yet, though! There's still a long walk through an alpine meadow, which was incredible. Our views at the golden hour were unreal. The BC wildfire smoke occluded our mountain view, but left us with a hazy yellow backdrop for the wildflowers, which were popping hard.Shortly before the lookout you'll pass\u00a0another moderately well-established campsite, but we pressed on with hope. Just as the sun was setting\u2014turning the smoke layer a brilliant salmon color\u2014we hit the top of the butte and hustled\u00a0to the lookout. A lookout that was empty. A lookout that was unlocked. OUR LOOKOUT!We ran around the deck screeching about our good fortune\u00a0for a long time, then set up our beds inside (on a cot and a wooden platform, both provided). We'd been prepared to bivy either on the deck or on the flatter ground far from the lookout. This was better. The smoke hung low on the foothills surrounding us, which made for a beautifully layered\u2014if atypical\u2014view from the top and Rainier poked her pretty little head out just to show off before the sky grew\u00a0dark. Some folks have left a few treasures in the lookout: camp chairs, jugs of water and dog bowls, a can of Rainier beer (cute), a packet of freeze-dried ice cream, soap... It was great to see the place well taken care of. The stars came out and the smoke stayed low enough for a while that I got some great time just hanging out with the bright night sky.Sleeping in the lookout is something I won't soon forget. The wind whistles loudly in the single-pane window frames (there's a sign saying the windows should not be opened) and something about sleeping in a fishbowl made me wake up several times imagining people were walking in (though we'd locked the door). No one was walking in. It was just us and the rocks and the wildflowers. (No marmots spotted, probably because we had a rambunctious dog with us.)We woke up early with the sun, packed our bags, and tromped down the trail to head back to work. The bugs were worse in the morning (curious!) and the dust was quite...dusty. We headed back to the office\u00a0and didn't stop smiling for days.I look forward to doing this trail again, though I don't expect to be this lucky next time!", "date": "Aug 3, 2017"}, {"comment": "Hiked with my dog on a Sunday afternoon.

Be sure to use the directions on WTA and not follow apple maps. I set my trip mileage so I could track each turn distance)!Put on some headlamps and layered up (it was 40 degrees and windy... where is summer!) and hiked up to the fire Lookout hoping to get some night hiking and spectacular sunrise. The clouds started rolling in thick as we approached the trailhead and drowning out the moon and our hope for a sunrise. We walked the not quite mile of old logging road to the trail and climbed steep switchbacks over rocks with only headlamps for light, feeling the biting cold wind and clouds surrounding us. I was scared to hike at night and also should have been scared of the cliffs we were climbing almost blindly up. I pushed through the fear though and climbed each switch back and I saw lots of wildflowers dancing in my headlamp beam. I was spooked by birds and mice and squirrels and the occasional smell of some other animal near by that we think was a bear (smelled it occasionally on the road from the parking lot and periodically while climbing the hill - that was probably the most unnerving part). Made it to the fire Lookout and it was completely clouded over. We noticed a couple of sleeping bags in the lookout (if that was you, sorry if we woke you when we stopped to enjoy our coffee and \"sunrise\" aka cold wind and thick clouds) :)Stayed through what should have been sunrise and headed back down, constantly amazed at all the new landscapes we missed on the way up. I noticed a family of mountain goats on a cliff off the trail and I enjoyed watching them for a bit before heading to the car. We saw a man driving in and he mentioned he watched a chocolate brown colored bear walk out from where we had been and walk across the clearing. Maybe that's what we smelled. Spooky but even though we missed the sunrise - it was still an amazing hike and I would come back again. Even with clouds. :)", "date": "Jul 16, 2017"}],

We drove north from Vancouver to Woodland, east on SR 503 through Cougar and continued on Forest Road 90 along Swift Reservoir to Pine Creek. We made a restroom stop at the Pine Creek Information Center, then turned north of Forest Road 25 for 25 miles, then west on Forest Road 99 for 4.6 miles to the Bear Meadow Viewpoint (restrooms available).\r We started the hike from the viewpoint parking lot (NWFP required) by crossing Road 99 and heading west on Boundary Trail #1. Almost immediately, we came to a view of Mount St. Helens far better than the one from Bear Meadow. The trail climbs up a draw in oldgrowth forest to an unmarked junction in .5 mile. We turned right onto Strawberry Mountain Trail #220.\r The trail has been neglected and is in danger of being abandoned, which would be a shame since most trails in the blast zone are closed to dogs. I strongly recommend that WTA put this trail into its 2016 maintenance program. It's a wonderful hike, but the trail needs brushing, some tread repair in a few spots, and logging out. Of approximately 30 logs across the trail, only about 6 are big and challenging crosscut jobs; the remainder could be easily handled with a bucking saw.\r The trail climbs steadily and steeply along a ridge above the headwaters of Wakepish Creek through beautiful oldgrowth forest. After about a mile, the grade lessens as the trail traverses the east side of Strawberry Mountain. Occasional windows through the trees provide glimpses of Mount Adams, the Goat Rocks and Mount Rainier.\r At 1.9 miles, the trail crests a knife-edge ridge. We were standing on the demarcation between the volcano blast zone and primeval forest, with our first views of the Green River valley to the west and first glimpse of Strawberry Mountain Lookout site ahead.\r The stumps below were left from post-eruption salvage logging. The salvaged areas were not replanted, so the forest is returning naturally, but slow enough that the views still are outstanding. For the next .3 mile, the trail climbs along the ridgecrest, with views east and west, arriving at an unmarked junction in a small saddle. The right fork is the continuation of Strawberry Mountain Trail #220. The left fork goes to the former fire lookout site.\r The trail climbs a steep, pumiced slope, passing some old propane tanks, to reach the summit and former Strawberry Mountain Lookout site, where a lookout tower stood from 1931-1967. We took a long lunch break here while we looked at the 360-degree view. A bald eagle flew overhead and we found ripe wild strawberries for which the mountain is named.\r To the south, we could see Strawberry Lake and into the crater of Mount St. Helens where Crater Glacier is wrapped around the lava domes. (We always carry binoculars for a better view.) We also could see Loowit Falls where the melting glacier water comes out of the crater.\r To the west, we looked at the Mount Margaret Backcountry across the valley. Grizzly Lake barely was visible and we could see the cirque basins of several other lakes. We looked directly down the glacially carved Green River valley, with Goat Mountain to the northwest. If Ascot Resources ever succeeds in developing a copper mine on Goat Mountain, this location will provide a ringside seat.\r Turning north, we looked down Quartz Creek valley and could see the Quartz Creek Big Trees rising above the surrounding second-growth forest. Mount Rainier stood above the continuing northward spine of Strawberry Mountain, which is a long ridge. To the east, we looked across the peaks and valleys of the Dark Divide Roadless Area to the Goat Rocks and Mount Adams. We could see Mount Hood and Mount Jefferson in Oregon, and perhaps the faintest glimmer of the North Sister on the south horizon.\r As we turned to hike back the way we came, we looked down into the valley below us where a small stream started on the west slope of Strawberry Mountain, and saw several cow elk with calves. Quite a few wildflower species were blooming along the trail, both on the open slope in the blast zone, and in the deep forest.\r Needless to say, we did not encounter any other hikers on this trail.", "date": "Jun 20, 2015"}, {"comment": "We chose this warm, sunny March Friday to hike from Ryan Lake up the 213 trail to the Strawberry Mountain trail, 220.  We did not make it to the top as the trail is not in good shape, transitioning from trail to old road to trail to old road.  In one place, we even lost the trail for a bit.  The upper part of the trail is losing tread, reducing the trail to about 8 inches wide and tilted.  There is also some stream damage on the upper trail.  The views, however, are amazing, with Mt. St. Helens, Mt. Whittier, Goat Mt., the Green River Valley and Ryan Lake spread out around us.

I brought yaktraks but never stopped to put them on. The snow seemed pretty dry and I wasn't having any issues with traction. About 20-30 minutes from the top I put on my snowshoes (my rentals--thanks, REI). Most of the time the snow wasn't that deep, it was just other footprints made icy. I kept turning my ankles weird, it was impossible to predict how each step would feel--drove me nuts. Snowshoes were much appreciated. Once you get the meadow-ish part the snow gets much deeper, maybe up to the knee? (I never took them off hehe)Got to the Lake around 12:30, and stopped for lunch. It was so pretty, everything blanketed in white. I enjoyed watching the snowflakes fall and the clouds move around the mountains.\u00a0I got cold though so I had to get moving again. I wanted to try and go up above the lake a little but I had no idea where the trail was and didn't feel like getting lost. Passed multiple groups on the way down, one guy with skis, one with snowshoes, a couple groups with neither. It was doable I think without snowshoes but it was snowing pretty good, could be considerably different by now.\u00a0I made it down to the parking lot by 2:15, making it just over four hours total time.

Total trip took me 56 hours.Started at the closed gate for Mount Rainier National Park on Hwk 123 mile post 2.6 at 6:50am, I hiked up the highway to the junction with Eastside Trail. Jumped on the trail and hiked up to about Deer Creek. Snow was about 1-2\" deep and slushy on the trail, no need for traction or flotation. I made the 12 miles to Deer creek in just over 4 hours.Just past Deer Creek\u00a0Camp the snow got deep enough for me to put on my Altai Hok skis. From there I turned up toward Cayuse Pass, and things got more serious. The snow was very deep, and the trail was very difficult to follow. I've previously done this hike in the summer, and so I recognized most of the area. Navigation required GPS and basically \"following the route\" by feel. I finally made it to the crossing of Hwy 123 around Cayuse pass at 3:40pm... the 3 miles took me over 4.5 hours. Another 4 hours to make it to Tipsoo Lakes where I camped in for a couple hours.I shoved off for day two around 3 am... the snow was deep and it was very slow going. It took me 6 hours to travel the 3 miles to Dewey Lakes. The PCT was a little easier to follow, but GPS and good route finding skills were still a must. After a very long day, I finally made it to the Laughingwater Creek Trail turn-off around 2am. I skied down a couple miles till I reached a lower elevation and found a good spot to bivvy for a couple hours.Started day three at first light, the snow was still thick and deep until about a mile past Three Lakes Camp and about 4,000ft of elevation. By then the trail was only covered in slush and so I took of my skis and hiked the remainder of the trail.

Some of the party came out at Chinook Pass on Day 3, and the rest carried on for two more days to exit at the Norse Peak Trailhead (near Crystal Mountain), where we stationed a car.Overview: The trail is easy to follow (well-marked), well-graded, dusty, and had a variety of scenery to keep us feeling satiated. We shared the trail with many through-hikers, and had one character spend the night in our campsite. Berries were at a peak- ripe, delicious and plentiful. Wildflowers were past their prime, but we could see the remnants of what must have been fields popping with color. Luckily bugs were also past their peak, and we only had a random mosquito or bee try to follow us along. We passed a variety of lakes, mudholes, ponds, and streams. We thoroughly enjoyed the unfolding scenery as we approached Chinook Pass. We had the Half Mile PCT app for the first 3 days, and found it very helpful for tracking\u00a0mileage and finding landmarks, lakes, spur trails and campsites. Wildfires are questionable in the Norse Peak area, so check the PCT closures site\u00a0and the Incident Information System for updates.\u00a0Day 1: White Pass to creek campsite (marked on the Half Mile PCT app as WACS2305 large creek, wooden bridge, several campsites) at mile 2304.8. Besides the ponds and lakes, there was no water running in the creeks up to this point (not even outflow streams from the lakes). The trail is almost completely flat for this section, going in and out of forest, passing a multitude of ponds, mudholes and lakes. The most scenic campsites were at Deer Lake, Pipe Lake and Snow Lake. Sand Lake and Buesch Lake were decent, too. Our campsite at the wooden bridge was large and flat, and the water was running brisk and cold. We stopped at Sand Lake for the eclipse! Total mileage ~12.Day 2: Creek campsite to Two Lakes. This day starts with a gentle descent towards Bumping Creek. Water is flowing again, and the forest is luscious. The Bumping Creek was cold, but not too hard to cross with water shoes and poles (one of us braved the log, but the rest opted to ford). We met Dora the through-hiker on the other side and chatted briefly before starting the climb up Crag Mountain. The views get better as you rise above Fish, Buck and Crag Lake. The trail became quite exposed and hot in the early afternoon, so we rested for lunch in the shade before reaching a great view point just before entering the Rainier NP boundary. You get your first views of Rainier here, and we loved watching the white cap come\u00a0in and out of view behind trees. Also the tip of St. Helens was barely viewable through the haze. We carried on, munching berries along the way, passed One Lake on the right, and found the signed trail for Two Lakes. It's a steep .3 mile down to the lake, with two nice waterfront campsites. The creek is dry, so we filtered from the lake, also enjoying a nice swim. Through-hikers had to go around to the campsite beyond the meadow, one coming down by headlamp around 9pm. Bats came out at dusk. ~8 milesDay 3: Two Lakes to Chinook Pass. This day boasted the best overall views. We could see Mt Rainier, St Helens, and Mt Adams as we coasted around the slope toward American Lake. The trail was a little up, then mostly flat and down, passing by lovely Anderson Lake and eventually the most scenic Dewey Lake. This lake boasts the turquoise color we look for in alpine lakes, and had many swimmable beaches, lake-side trail, and nice campsites. We met our day-hiking friends there who brought us a restock and took our backpacking couple\u00a0out from Chinook Pass. The Dewey Lake trail to Chinook Pass had blooming\u00a0flowers, scenic valley views, and a lovely little un-named lake as you descend to the pass. Highway 410 was closed heading east just beyond the trailhead for fires. After the restock, the three of us remaining headed on to Sheep Lake (after seeing a bear down in the meadow below 410!). The last 1.5 miles seemed long after an already epic day. Sheep Lake was quaint, and had some nice flat (and dusty) campsites. Fog rolled in that night. From Two Lakes ~8 miles to Chinook, then another 1.5\u00a0miles to Sheep Lake.Day 4: Sheep Lake to Basin Lake. We climbed up from Sheep Lake to Sourdough Gap. We were socked in with clouds, so couldn't see any views. We did see one marmot and 3 through-hikers! After the gap, we coasted down, and then across a slope sighting Placer Lake (and another bear down in lake basin!) and on over to Bear Gap (wind whistling and cold clouds moving through). We could see nothing through the fog, so continued on ridge-top and slope-walks, over Pickhandle Ridge and Panhandle Pass, saw a few firefighters having lunch at the Union Creek junction, and carried on (up and flat) until Scout Pass. Here you cross from western slope to east-facing slope, and the views began to clear. The terrain looks more arid along this ridge overlooking the Norse Peak Wilderness. We could barely see smoke beyond the ridge behind Basin Lake. Not having seen or heard anything about trail closures, we headed on to camp at Basin Lake. The sign for Basin Lake is laying in the scree, so we missed it the first time around and had to backtrack. The trail down to Basin is steep, dusty, and not well-graded. I swear it's longer than the signed 1/4 mile (the book says 1/2)! We saw lots of goat remnants, and were surprised to not see any actual goats (except for a few up on Norse Peak). There is an epic campsite on the far end of the lake with a wooden bench and lots of flat space. The outflow stream is a great water source right beside the campsite. That evening we heard planes and helicopters beyond the ridge managing the fire, and even had a helicopter scoop water out of Basin Lake several times right in front of us! Were we supposed to evacuate?? No way to know. The wind was blowing away and the air was clear of smoke that night, so we opted to stay. Cold winds that evening. 8-9 milesDay 5: Basin Lake to Norse Peak trailhead. That morning we had frost on our packs. We headed out early and watched smoke roll in as we left the lake basin. When we reached the PCT, heavy smoke was pouring into the area, and we were glad to be leaving! Our Green Trails map was slightly different than the printed map from Half Mile, and we were unable to find the first junction with the Norse Peak Trail that was apparently supposed to be heading west at the Crow Lake Junction. We headed on to Barnard Saddle to find unmarked trail 1161 heading off the PCT by Goat Lake. The trail looked well-used and was the only significant trail heading west/southwest from that area. We descended, noting Castle Rock above and Goat Lake below, so knew it was the right trail. There was an area of washed-out trail on the scree that had us taking off packs and scrambling to get across. Beyond the obvious switchback at about 1.8 miles, we passed a horse camp and started heading down. Soon enough we hit the junction with Norse Peak Trail (1191) and knew we were on track! Then we headed down, down, down to the trailhead by 1:30pm. All in a day's work! ~8 miles.", "date": "Aug 21, 2017"}, {"comment": "A glorious intro to the PCT trail!

We then shuttled in a friends car to White Pass TH, about 45 minutes of a drive from Chinook Pass. Note that we used the NW pass to park at Chinook TH. We also had an interagency pass and later on the trail regretted we didn't use that instead, just to be doubly sure of the boundaries. We did not get ticketed and were relieved that we had not violated the rules.\u00a0Day 1: 7.5 miles\u00a0Started at 12:30 p.m. Pitched tent at 7:00p at Snow Lake campsite. Our other campsite options were at Sand, Beuch or Pipe Lakes but we wanted to get in as much as we comfortably could on day1.\u00a0Several breaks on the way enjoying the scenery and pretty mellow trail. It was a humid day so we took our time to get acclimatized to the sweatyness. Start at Leech Lake (0 miles) to Sand Lake (at 3 miles) to Buesch Lake (~4.0 miles) Pipe Lake (at 5 miles) and pushed on to Snow lake (at 7.5 miles). Several campsites available here. Met thru-hiker \"Red Cross\" and section hiker Cramers here. Shared a few trail experiences, went to the lake by the night to catch some Perseid Meteor Shower action and then called it a night. A critter sniffed its nose into our fellow camper's tent but otherwise a quiet night.\u00a0Day 2: 11.5 miles\u00a0Started at 8:30 a.m. Pitched tent at 6:00p at Two Lakes campsite.\u00a0Long day with plenty breaks to make respite for an uphill climb. Again, pretty rolling terrain until you reach the Bumping River Crossing. This crossing is tricky for less experienced. There is a log bridge to cross, about 4.5-5 feet high. But its a bit narrow and bowing in the middle when our friend crossed it. The other two of us decided to ford the river. Two other hikers came by around the same time so we scouted for a shallow spot to cross and forded together. Experienced company builds confidence for sure! You reach a meadow immediately after the river crossing, a beautiful place to camp too. We hiked on, missed fish lake entirely but we weren't planning to stop by there anyways so it was okay. You know you are on the climb to Crag Lake shortly after the river crossing. We had done about 5 miles since morning so far. Our options were to camp at Crag Lake (~7.5 miles from Snowlake) or push on to Two Lakes (10.5 miles from Snowlake) or stretch on to American Lake (13 miles from Snow Lake). We refilled water at Crag Lake and then decided since we had a bit more before the sun starts setting in that we'd stop at Two Lakes for the night camp. You will enter the Rainer National Park boundary and if its a good day, a glorious greeting from the mountain herself. It was a good day for us!! It was a sound decision to stop at 2 Lakes, giving us just enough time to set camp, cook, stow away of bear cannisters, chat with a friendly family of 4 on a summer trip and then call it a day. We got rained in all night. Probably a deer lurking around our tents in the night as we heard gentle munching and grazing. We didn't get out of our tents to check haha. Do note that the Two Lakes is about 0.3 miles downhill from the mail PCT trail.\u00a0Day 3: 11 miles. Started at 9:00a, reached Chinook Pass at 5:00 p.m.\u00a0Last day on our trip. Met several thru hikers - Zen, Newton, Medic. All were so friendly and answered any questions we had about their journey or ours! We climbed out of Two Lakes Trail to American Lake (in about 2.5 miles). Here we see a sign that inform the distance from American Lake to Dewey Lake is 3.7 miles. Anderson Lake falls just in between and makes for a nice lunch or snack spot. Its mostly a downward trail till you hit Dewey Lake. A gorgeous lake. Its huge and blue. And you walk by the lake shore for atleast a mile, its heavenly. Once you cross Dewey lake its the last climb up to Chinook pass. Many views of the lake but we were also partly socked in the rain and fog so didn't get much of the promised upper elevation views of the mountains. We were still happy with our lot, it was that kind of a giving trail! We made a final stop at the Naches loop viewpoint and then hiked to the Chinook Pass trailhead by around 5:00p.m. If you want to catch the tipsoo lake, take a left to Tipsoo Lake at the Naches Loop junction, instead of the PCT trail. Either way, great views. Just need to be planful on which route to take to align with your vehicle parked at the trailhead!\u00a0All in all, a great trip! An excellent intro to backpacking, lakes, meadows, mountains, critters, climbs, fording, wildflowers, apline berries.\u00a0\u00a0", "date": "Aug 11, 2017"}, {"comment": "Gorgeous trail, even if we missed the mountain views because of rain! Lakes, berries, and wildflowers for days! We did 2 nights, 3 days, about 10 miles per day, going from White to Chinook, staying at snow lake on night one and two lakes on night two. I was glad we grabbed a map of the whole trail, because there were a few junctions that puzzled, but all in all a very straightforward trail. The grade on the trail is seldom very steep, though there are some longer stretches of uphill. I would recommend if you're a slower hiker that you add an additional night so you have time to stop and enjoy your hike\u2026 faster hikers should also make time to stop and enjoy, in my opinion. There's so much to see! The trail was extremely dusty till it rained, so gaiters are a good idea. Bugs were annoying but I've had worse. The one and only river crossing of note was an easy ford. I watched someone cross the log and said \"no thank you!\"", "date": "Aug 11, 2017"}],

The road up to Crystal has four construction zones and there will be some minor holdups. We then drove another vehicle to Chinook Pass and headed up the PCT to Sheep Lake. There we spent time photographing some of the wildflowers in the area which included the meadow just above the lake. Finding a few elephant head flowers was unusual but then we found a small area where there were about a hundred along with queen's cup and magenta paintbrush mixed with lupine, columbine and tiger lilies. A little higher up, Mount Adams, Goat Rocks, Mount St Helens and Sheep Lake came into view.\r We reached Sourdough Gap where we ran into a couple guys hiking the PCT from White Pass to the Canadian border. A few hundred feet later we bypassed the continuation of the PCT to take a short jaunt northwest over the ridge to hit the Crystal Lakes trail to take in the view of Mount Rainier with Crystal Lake in the foreground  and the backtracked to the PCT and continued northeast along the ridge we stopped to have lunch with a view of Placer Lake below. Going on from there we reached Bear Gap at about 6.1 miles. The junction there has four choices, we took the Silver Creek Trail (No.1192) and headed down about two miles to end at the Crystal Mountain resort area. Our total distance was 8.8 miles with a 1410 foot gain.", "date": "Aug 3, 2016"}, {"comment": "We hiked 8 miles north on the PCT from Chinook Pass. \r There are no difficult snow fields from Chinook Pass to Scout Pass.

We parked one car, got in the other car and drove to Chinook Pass.  There was several feet of snow at Chinook Pass.  Tina assured us that this is an easy hike, so we started on the trail next to the restrooms.  None of us were really prepared for snow but we were able to find Sheep lake with not too much trouble.  Sheep Lake should have been called Snow lake because it was 90% snow and ice.  From Sheep Lake we were able to see the ridge we needed to get to, and after a lengthy discussion we decided to continue on.  The trail was completely covered in snow.  With help from the gps and instinct we made it to the ridge.  Again, we discussed turning back, but with blue skies and an itch for hiking we continued.  From here we stayed high on the ridge; although,  we should have descended down then back up.  This took energy and time.  We eventually were able to find the trail.  The trail was visible off and on throughout the hike; unfortunately, the many snowfields we crossed were steep and more dangerous then safe.  Micro spikes and poles would have been very useful.  Through LUCK, patience, toughness and desire we were able to make it to Bear Gap.  From here we descended, on snow,  to Hen Skin Lake, six hours and 9 1/2 miles later we made it to Crystal Mt. parking lot, where cold beer and dry clothes were waiting.  If we knew then what we know now, we would have waited until July to attempt this hike.", "date": "Jun 4, 2016"}, {"comment": "We decided to hike into Basin Lake via Cement Basin from the Bear Gap trailhead, and loop out on the PCT south.  The first major problem was that the trailhead sign and wilderness permits ARE NOT at the start of the trail.  The trail actually starts a mile farther up the road that says \"no trailer turnaround\" and is marked by a tiny sign saying \"trail\"  We parked at the first trailhead sign and followed a maze of elk trails, finally ended up going straight uphill until almost the PCT junction.  After that, the trails were all pretty easy to follow, except...we made it through Cement Basin, up a pretty steep pass and down to beautiful Basin Lake, home to ducks and goats on Saturday, but no other people.  Then we tried to follow the trail out from the north end of the lake, got on apparently a new trail used by horse folks, and ended up at the shelter in Big Crow Basin, a couple of miles north of where we wanted to hit the PCT.  We finally got on the PCT south, and had no trouble finding the trail into Basin Lake as it is marked.  Next time we will know better.  The hike back out was uneventful, cold and windy, and Mt. Rainier never showed through the clouds.  We passed 4 PCTers, 2 campers and 2 bow hunters in our trip.  The trail back down to the real Bear Gap trailhead is decent, and had nice color.", "date": "Sep 26, 2015"}, {"comment": "This was a one-way \"through hike\". We left our vehicle at the Crystal Mountain parking lot and got a ride to the Chinook Pass parking lot and got on the PCT heading northeast above Hwy 410 for a ways for a slight gain. We began to move away from the highway going a bit east into the forest and in two miles arrived at east side of Sheep Lake and stopped to take in the view. After the lake we began gaining elevation again working our way up the rock ridge to our left. We reached Sourdough Gap at 3.2 miles and dropped down about a hundred feet to PCT signed junction. From here we took a short side trail that took us over the ridge and on a trail above Upper Crystal Lake with a view of Rainier. This short jaunt off the PCT is well worth the effort as it is the only place with a full view of Mount Rainier and you get a lake thrown in as a bonus!\r  Returning to the PCT we continued on the trail to a point above Pacer Lake for lunch. at about 5 miles. From there it was a bit over a mile to the junction at Bear Gap. We took the Silver Creek Trail No. 1192 and began a steep 2.2 mile descent back to the Crystal Mountain ski resort parking lot. Including a couple short side trips for views we had a total of 8.9 miles.\r Except for the area around Sheep Lake where there is camping, we saw few hikers on the trail. There were a few through hikers on the PCT but we met no one on the Sliver Creek trail. This is a great hike for views of lakes (Sheep, Upper Crystal, Placer) and views of Mount Adams and Rainier. About a mile before Crystal Mountain on the Silver Creek trail we stopped to look at an abandoned mine and a stream. Some of the berry bushes are beginning to turn and the rock formations that form the ridge to the west are stunning.", "date": "Aug 19, 2015"}],

At times we went 6 miles without another water source. Not a big deal if you know to plan for it, but can get uncomfortable if you aren't aware of it, and don't plan on it.\u00a0Also, all of the trails leading east were closed as of 8/22 because of the fires, so don't plan doing any side trips, as almost all of the trails we came across were closed.\u00a09/10\u00a0We got to the pass around 11:30, and made it around 10 miles, camped right before Lake Alaska, and right after Gavel Lake.

We saw a bear down in the valley, around 200 yards below us, getting ready for the winter. Lunch by a waterfall. End of the day climb, around 2,000 ft was pretty brutal after a long day of hiking. Lots of up. Could see the smoke from the fires in the distance, but no smoke in the air near us.

Saturday night after our work we went up to Slate Peak for the views.  Even thought this was my third time here, it only confirms it as my most favorite part of the PCT in Washington.\rThe road up was just as  I remember it, washboards and cliff hugging as always.

The last bit of road up to Slate Peak was very eroded and rocky.\rThe fall colors were abound and the larches were doing their thing, slowly but surely.  Winter is definitely on it's way as the trees held ice on their higher limbs all day and the lookout on the peak was dropping icy slivers off the mesh on the guard rails in the afternoon sun that had frozen the night before.  You could see dustings of snow on the surrounding higher peaks as we enjoyed the 360 views from Slate.\rDon't forget it is the season for that lovely hunter orange; we saw many trucks filled with camouflaged \"hikers\".\r Link below to a few more pics.  :)", "date": "Sep 24, 2016"}, {"comment": "One of the best trails in Washington!

Immediately turn left onto paved Panther Creek Road 65. Drive about 4 miles, passing Panther Creek Campground, crossing Panther Creek, and make a sharp right turn onto gravel Road 68. The road climbs about 2 miles. At the crest of the ridge, pull off into an unmarked parking area on the right; there is a Wind River Experimental Forest sign on the left. This is the unmarked PCT crossing of the road.\r  The day was overcast so it didn't matter that there aren't any significant views along this forested ridge-top hike. The trail climbs through a pair of switchbacks in the first half mile, then goes into a long, climbing traverse of the ridge. At about 2 miles, the trail crosses an open bald; at 2.6 miles the PCT passes a junction with the abandoned Cedar Creek Trail, although a sign still marks it on the tree. At about 3 miles, the PCT passes under rock outcrops covered with Rock Penstemon (not blooming now) and climbs to another bald.\r We diverted onto the bald for a lunch break. We could see the Columbia River Gorge off to the distance in the south and lots of cloud shrouded mountains around us. In spring, this bald would be covered in wildflowers.\r Since Big Huckleberry does not offer any views -- trees long ago reclaimed this old fire lookout site -- so we decided not to continue on another half mile to the junction with the Grassy Knoll Trail. The \"South Cascades\" guidebook errs when it says there is not a path to the summit of Big Huckleberry. The trail takes off to the right immediately past the junction with the Grassy Knoll Trail and climbs about 1/4 mile to the top.\r During our hike, we encountered about 20 PCT \"through hikers\" but no one else. We saw lots of berries and a few late-blooming flower species. We capped off the day with a stop at the dog-friendly Walking Man Brew Pub in Stevenson for drinks and dinner.\r As a post-script, the role of experimental forests has changed a lot from the days when they were established to study logging and silvicultural practices. Today, the National Ecological Observatory Network, a nationwide research effort to investigate the impacts of climate change, land-use change, and invasive species ecology, is proposing to gather instrumental and observational data over 30 years in the Wind River Experimental Forest. The research will include soil, atmospheric, aquatic and terrestrial studies.", "date": "Sep 4, 2016"}, {"comment": "PCT section hike from Panther Creek to Columbia River. FLOWERS WERE INCREDIBLE! Over 60 varieties that we counted and I know we missed a lot too. Using two cars, we completed this stretch of the crest, heading southbound. No water from Three Corner Rock south until reaching Greenleaf Creek 10+ miles away. The section b/w Panther Creek to Three Corner Rock -- water is plentiful for most of it. As for camping, there are several nice sites by the bridge that crosses the main Trout Creek. Note that about 0.3 miles south of there, the bridge that crosses the tributary of Trout Creek is out, but the water is easily crossed by rock hopping. Several parties of PCT volunteers were clearing trail this weekend....many thanks to your time and hard work. Trees cleared, trail rebuilt in spots, brush cleared. Awesome! As for camping south of Trout Creek, no really good spots until about 1/2 mile before reaching Snag Creek. A short distance before reaching Snag Creek, you cross a forest service road. But about a 1/3 of a mile before that road is a very nice, fairly large and flat campsite on the left side of the trail (southbound), with a side creek just below for water. At Snag Creek itself further down, I didn't see any spots. Rock Creek had a few VERY small (one man tent and not much room for else) sites. Unless there were more that weren't obvious that you had to bushwhack to. Most of the trail is in the trees with some open areas to see the surrounding ridges. Granted, most of our views were limited b/c of the weather and low clouds/drizzle. But it made us focus downward to the wonderful flower show.

The PCT section of this day hike is already covered in snow, not enough to need snowshoes or traction (microspikes); however, enough to need gaiters and boots to avoid water in your shoes. Several water sources along the way for you to filter/drink. We saw at least 4 parties camping at Snowy Lakes.

I've really, REALLY wanted to fit this trip in during larch season. Ever since I first glimpsed the area from near Granite Pass...I've wanted to go. I talked to Steve, he was interested. Early on in the week the weather looked decent with mostly or partly sun and little chance of precip (snow). Late in the week it changed, a good chance for up to 8\" of snow and some windy conditions. Nothing seemed to troubling so we decided to go for it. We left town early, it's about a 3 hour drive just to get to the trailhead at Rainy Pass....then there is the 10+ mile hike in to the lakes. It would be a long day... We left the trailhead (about 4900') a bit later than planned (around 10:30am) but under mostly clear skies and warmer temps than I was expecting. We knew weather was going to move in later in the day so the goal was to get into camp before the worst of it hit. We made decent time up the PCT and hit what I call the first viewpoint at about noon and could see that golden larch color we came to the area to see. In the middle of the prettiest part of the trail I saw Elle (and Izzy)...then Yoko (and Maya) and then Sandra and Barb. It was such a nice surprise to bump into them! The trail rounds the head of the drainage and reached Cutthroat Pass at about 5 miles (6897') at about 1:30pm and we stopped for a late and short lunch. We still had another 5+ miles to go and sunset is at about 6:30pm. We continued north on the PCT and gawked quite a bit at the golden larch colors and reached a highpoint on the trail before it switches back steeply downhill to Granite Pass (about 6.3mi, 6870'). The time to lose some elevation... The trail has several short/tight switchbacks as it heads down to Granite Pass. Thankfully there wasn't any snow/ice on the trail. We reached the pass at about 7.3mi (6267') losing about 600' (it would feel like more on our trip out). Now it was time for the long traverse over to where we had to cut off to head to the lakes. The PCT here is generally in good shape...nice and wide with a great PCT grade (nothing ever too steep). Near the cut off to head to the lakes though...about a mile from the cut off...there is a series of eroded gullies that the trail cuts across. These places rattled my nerves a bit. The trail is narrower that the rest of the stretch and the drop off is severe. But...none of those crossings is ever too long and the trail ever too narrow to be a real problem. It did get me wondering what it would be like to cross if those spots had some snow. Eventually we reached the giant white rock at the spot described where we needed to head uphill at 9.3mi (6235'). The boot path uphill to the lakes was as expected pretty distinct. It was easy to follow. Along the way we did see some flagging. I don't think this \"trail\" up to the lakes is an official trail but I could be wrong. Looks like the trail has been marked for some improvements. By now both Steve and I were starting to get tired...OK...more than just a little. At 9.8mi from the TH (about .5 from the PCT) we reached the outlet to Lower Snowy Lks (6741') and took a short break...a water break. There is little to no water along the trail from the gushing stream way down low in the Porcupine Ck drainage below Cutthroat Pass. We gulped down some water and then continued the last bit of uphill, another .3 miles (10.17mi from the TH, 6874') to the outlet of Upper Snowy Lks. Both lakes were absent of other hikers/tents. It was getting late, the wind was starting to pick up, we were both tired. Where to camp? The wind was pretty bad at the lower lake, about the same at the outlet to the upper lake. I dropped my pack to scout out a site that was somewhat protected. I found a decent site (there may have been a better one but we didn't have the luxury of time to find it). I met back up with Steve at the lake outlet, we hauled our stuff to the site, and then struggled to set up the tent without the wind blowing our gear all over the place. It was obvious later that others had been in the area recently...I found a tent stuff sack nearby. As soon as the tent was up we emptied our packs into it. Steve dove into his sleeping bag and I volunteered to make a couple of trips down to the lake to get water to filter and boil. It was a late dinner and by then it was just way to windy to do anything but hang out inside the tent. After dinner we secured our gear as best we could and then listened to a podcast..then we tried to get some sleep. Sleep came hard because the wind was howling outside. It seemed more like sleet than snow was coming down and my mind couldn't stop thinking about those gully crossings. Neither of us could fall asleep. Finally...around 2am...Steve says a mouse in trying to get into the tent. It had chewed a small hole in the tent trying to get it. That made sense...I my semi sleep state I had seen dark shapes sliding down the tent between the tent and the rain fly. Hard to believe that at nearly 7000' and with those temperature that there would be varmints! Eventually we did get some sleep. By early morning the wind seemed to die down a bit. We were up about 8:30am and talked about plans. This was originally planned as a 3 day trip. We woke to find 2-3 inches of new snow had fallen overnight. More snow was expected during the day and even more the following night. It looked to be a day that was too windy and cold to do anything but hunker down inside the tent. The weather for Sunday was forecasted to be better but who knew for sure? I did get a current weather forecast from my inReach and it mentioned continued snow, wind, and low 20 degree temps. We decided to pack up and head out. I had hoped for a rest day for my knees but that wasn't to be. We were packed up and moving by 9:30am. We had several inches of snow down to Lower Snowy Lk. It lessened as we dropped down to the PCT. By the time we were back on the PCT it was just a dusting. Those eroded gullies were still on my mind but when we reached them we found them snow free! From the cut off to the lakes, the PCT as it head south loses about 100' before slowly heading uphill back to Granite Pass. The PCT remained snow free until right before Granite Pass. As we headed up the trail on the other side of the pass the switchbacks became increasingly covered in snow...but thankfully only snow. The close we got to Cutthroat Pass the deeper the snow got. The deepest snow (6\"-8') was on the south side of the ridge between Pt 7331 and Pt 6990. It wasn't until we got to this section of trail that we finally saw other people...all of which appeared equipped just for the day. No other backpackers... Finally rounding the cover at Pt 7331 we could faintly see Cutthroat Pass through the increasingly heavy snow coming down. Big flakes. Crazy big flake were coming down. It looked more like Winter up at the pass instead of early Fall. We reached the pass and then dropped down the Porcupine drainage. I always forget how long this stretch of trail is. I think it is a few miles but it is always 2 miles longer than my memory! The snow followed us all the way back down to the car. Both of us were surprised to see it snowing at the trailhead. Winter in the North Cascades has arrived.Stats: 20.57mi, 4148'' gain (round trip)More photos at the links below.", "date": "Oct 6, 2017"}, {"comment": "Outstanding trip.\u00a0 Killer views and flawless weather!\u00a0 Upper passes/traverses are simply incredible.\u00a0 Lots of through-hikers to chat with and finishing their trips last few miles to Canada from Mexico (so impressive; wow!).\u00a0 It's tough for me to get away on a trip like this for one night, much less 5 months!\u00a0 LOL", "date": "Sep 25, 2017"}],

I had been planning to start at the Suiattle River but with the uncertainty of the road closing again due to fire opted to begin at White River.Day 1:Began hiking a bit after 9 am, later than I'd hoped. The parking area at Grasshopper Meadows was already nearly full. The trip began with a 2 mile road walk, the road closed due to a small washout and long stream channel that had carved a foot-deep trench for a long stretch of the road. Thankfully this went quickly. A short distance up the Indian Creek trailhead two girls out for a run passed me but turned back at the first sign of overgrowth. I kept plugging along. The first six or so miles of the trail is quite pleasant through deep forest, with small brushy areas. The last six or seven to Indian Pass is overgrown, faint, and has downed trees. Not too hard to follow the route but not difficult. I slowly made my way on and setup camp at Indian Pass. Surprisingly I was the only one there! I thought for sure I'd at least have some thru-hiker company. Bugs were kind of annoying, especially as the temperature dropped, but overall a pleasant camp.14.6 miles, 3438 ft gain.Day 2:My plan for this trip was no morning alarm clock and to be in camp by 6pm every night. No alarm needed since it was plenty warm at sunrise and I was ready to get moving. I quickly packed, ate a nice granola and Nido breakfast supplemented by the huckleberries growing an arm lenght's away, then was off. I love this stretch of PCT and had a pleasant slow walk up to Reflection Ponds and on to White Pass. Flowers are mostly done except for one very nice pocket of lupine and lots of yellow corn lillies. As I enjoyed a snack break at White Pass a southbound thru hiker going by \"Pony\" stopped by and asked to send a message home through my inReach. She had lost hers a day or two before and wanted to let her family in Australia know she was ok. I promised to look for it, though Yana (hiking a half day or so ahead of me) found it first.Another nice stretch of trail to Red Pass, then down into the basin along Baekos Creek. I dropped my pack and went up to a little bump for a view of White Chuck Cinder Cone. Then a long drop along very pretty trail into the forest. Many fantastic campsites along the way, with a very pleasant creek flowing through an increasingly narrow valley. Incredibly clear and cold water! As I dropped further I hiked a mile or two with an older guy doing a section hike from N Fork Sauk to the Suiattle where his wife would pick him up. We parted ways at the old Kennedy Hot Springs junction, which is totally destroyed.From there the PCT is fairly rough, by PCT standards anyway. Several muddy areas, some larger blowdowns, and then a broken bridge crossing the White Chuck River. I couldn't believe the thing was still there! It was broken and draped in the river way back in 2012! I had a nice break here, was passed by a few thru hikers whose names I didn't catch, and began the long climb up Kennedy Ridge. Neat stretch of trail through a narrow but forested ridge. I made camp in a deep valley with a great stream running down through nice meadows, taking a higher site off trail with some seclusion. It was so warm with no wind I only setup my bug bivy and stayed plenty warm. Towards sunset two German thru-hikers, who didn't have real trail names but were sometimes called the \"wild turkeys\" showed up.16.6 miles, 3745 ft gain.Day 3:Sunrise brought me up early again and I was on my way. Not too far up the trail a tree had fallen at the end of a switchback. I spotted it and avoided the issue but a few switchbacks higher I saw a thru-hiker far below off trail in the meadows. He'd walked off the end of the switchback after crossing the tree. We hiked on and off the rest of the day. He had a sweet handle-bar mustache and was known as \"Mr. Money Mustache\". I was much faster on the uphill, surprisingly, and he was faster going downhill so we ran into eachother many times.At Fire Creek Pass I went to the top of a little knob for a snack break and saw several people go past going either direction. Sadly the fire smoke had taken any views at this point. I debated turning around, maybe finishing off the Pilot Ridge Loop, but decided smoke had already compromised my Copper Ridge trip and it wouldn't get this one too! I dropped down the many switchbacks to Mica Lake, finding an older couple with a really comfortable camp setup. I went to a nice beach area for a very brief swim in the cold water, then began the long drop down into Milk Creek.Amazingly the FS and PCTA had done some work on this part! Not far below Mica I found a brand new sign, and a sign for a new toilet! Toilets on the PCT, these thru hikers have it easy nowadays. They had also thankfully brushed out the descent making it far less miserable. It was also kind of a blessing not to see the switchbacks ascending the other side of the valley. That was demoralizing enough in 2012. I reached the bottom, had lunch, and relaxed a bit before the big climb back out of the valley. It was quite warm.The climb back up was tiring. I can't believe I went all the way from Red Pass down through here and up the other side and still had energy to get to Vista Camp as a thru hiker. Missed that conditioning. Another new toilet a mile or so up. I finished the climb and ran very low on water at the top. It was very dry. I found water in the basin, as well as a large group of tents setup below. I crossed paths with the Germans again, loaded up on water, and found a nice camp on Grassy Point. Trip-planning-me had originally through trail-hiking-me would have energy to hike out to Grassy Point - what an idiot! I lounged around awhile, took a short nap, and walked nearly a mile out on the ridge to see how far the trail was still easy to spot. Easy to spot the whole way, though I left the rest for later. Another warm dead calm night with no need for a tent. Bug bivy was great due to many yellowjackets though. Fairly nice star show though the haze kept the milk way a bit dim.16.9 miles, 4415 ft gain.Day 4:Creepy red devil eye sunrise through the fire smoke. But slightly more visibility! I packed up camp, hiked up the trail a ways, then went straight up slope to the top of Pt.6678, stashing my pack along the way. Surely I wouldn't regret this one mile and 678ft gain detour? (narrator voice: he would). Views of Glacier Peak were stupendous and the route up wasn't difficult. There was also a nice bivy spot on the ridge with a small fading snow patch for water.Then it was a long drop down into the Suiattle. Surprisingly dry through Vista Camps. Down along Vista Creek a thru hiker named Whimsy asked if I was going to look for the log. I said no, using the bridge. No thru hiker I talked to seemed to believe the log was still there. The trail to the bridge does go through some fantastic old growth! When I thru hiked I cheated and used the log so this was all new to me. Sadly I miscalculated how far down the bridge was and my day ended up 3 miles longer because of it!On the other side I began the slow climb back up the PCT / Suiattle River trail. A few miles later I left the PCT and went up to Miner's Ridge. Five miles more to Image Lake but the trail is very smooth and pleasant for tired legs. Surprisingly I found another new toilet here too, at the junction of the trail to Miner's Ridge and Suiattle Pass. Also two tents setup, with one woman deeply engrossed in a book and not even noticing me. I had a snack break and then continued up. Still very smokey around Glacier Peak but views to the north were quite clear. I went up to the lookout and found it's occupant Russ working on the foundation. He'd been there since July 13th and hadn't seen his wife in three weeks when she hiked partway up to bring him a slice of pie and fresh fruit. I also found Lindsey and Gabriel's names in the register! I hung around a bit and then moved on to Image Lake for the night, stopping for another swim along the way.Surprisingly full camping at the lake, far more people than we'd had on the 4th of July in 2015. There was also a small tree in the lower camps heavily flagged with tape reading \"bees!\". They weren't kidding, there was a large hive! I went back up to the high camps and took the last flat spot, returning to the lake to watch a fairly nice sunset and have dinner. Bugs were a bit annoying. Used the full tent this night for privacy. Warm night again.20.8 miles, 4955 ft gain.Day5:Clear skies! Went back up to the lake for another photo, then along the ridge with great views over to Glacier Peak. Red meadows, lots of berries, and yellow corn lillies everywhere. I wandered along, keeping a slower pace to enjoy the views, and before long rejoined the PCT. I was a south-bounder for a short stretch here, crossing paths with another German hiker named \"Pudge\" who was very skinny. Several other people out doing the Spider Meadows / Buck Creek Pass loop.Going up to Middle Ridge I finally saw a bear! I was starting to think I'd somehow finish this loop through the heart of the Glacier Peak Wilderness without seeing one. It was across the little valley slurping up huckleberries unaware I was watching. I took some photos, then moved on to the top of Middle Ridge for lunch. Back at Image Lake I'd discovered I'd somehow lost my bag of freeze dried chicken salad so my lunches the rest of the trip weren't satisfied. I guess I should be grateful I had so many tortillas anyway.Another drop and climb and I found myself at Buck Creek Pass. I hadn't been here for over 10 years and had forgotten how pretty it was! Beautiful fall meadows, blue skies, whispy clouds, and no people! I debated camping here since the primo site was free but I knew better was awaiting at High Pass. I stashed my pack, made a quick trip out to Flower Dome, then onwards. Great trail and increasing views the higher I went. Fantastic meadows and good trail the whole way.At the pass I ran into three guys, one who seemed to be carrying an easel and canvas. Would have been interesting to see what he painted. I dropped a bit towards Triad Lake for a view and to collect some water, then up to High Pass. Years ago I'd needed an ice axe. This time any snow was easily avoided. What an incredible place! Grand peaks with glaciers, smaller grassy knobs, a pretty lake, and whispy clouds. I hoped to setup camp on the ridge but it was far too windy. I found a reasonably sheltered camp down in the valley, then climbed back up high for dinner and sunset. Great sunset! I closed up my pyramid tent expecting to get cold overnight.17.9 miles, 4962 ft gain.Day 6:I expected to get cold way up here overnight, having packed light on warm clothes and figuring I could ride out one high camp. I was glad I had fully anchored everything because around midnight I heard raindrops! A heavy cloud had descended and the high winds pelted my tent. Having a very sturdy pyramid tent was very nice and I stayed pleasantly dry, though everything else around me was soaked.Morning brought a very thick cloud and maybe 20 ft of visibilty. I had planned to wander around High Pass a bit but there wasn't much point with no views. I waited until about 9 am when the winds subsided and packed up, descending into the Napeequa valley. At first finding the route was tricky with no visibility but lower it became much more apparent. Route finding was very self explanatory, following the creek down through really nice meadows. I did wish I'd brought gaiters since my legs and feet were quickly soaked from the wet plants.Marmots everywhere. Green meadows. A nice creek. Flowers. Puffy white clouds. Glaciers. An entire day without seeing a human. This is what wilderness should be! I kept dropping down, slowed by photo ops, and before long reached the end of the upper valley. A large snowfield and failing snowbridge over the creek marked the end. I moved to hikers right and easily found the descending trail into the Napeequa proper. Steep trail, dusty and slippery in places, but not difficult to follow at all. Before long I was down along the river. A bit confusing here as I initially through I had to ford the river, only to discover on the far side that was a mistake, then crossed back. Oh well. Felt good on sore feet.Then it was a nice walk down the valley on surprisingly good trail. Far less brushy than Indian Creek and very pretty. Awhile later I reached the actual ford for the ascent to Boulder Pass. This one was much deeper, nearly crotch deep on me and I'm 5'9\" but with short legs. The deepest part is only 10 ft or so but this is a real river crossing. I made it across, had a nice lunch and dried out my soggy gear in the sun.Then it was up and up to Boulder Pass with nice views down to the snaking Nappeequa as I went. Some nice meadows below Boulder Pass were inviting to stop but my inner thru-hiker convinced me to keep moving on. Also making my final day shorter meant I'd find real food sooner. The views at the pass were quite nice but also windy. I could see small clouds forming and dissipating at the tops of the peaks. I crossed over the pass and had a nice break picking and eating fat huckleberries before dropping into the valley.Down below I reached an unsigned trail junction. I wandered out along it for a photo before returning, finding a nice camp not far below with a toilet. I was tempted to stay but once again the thru hiker in me said it was too early, keep moving. I figured I'd find something a bit lower but also forgot I was no longer on the PCT with established camps all over the place. In the end I had to walk all the way down to the White River before finding a great camp along the river, reaching that about 7pm. Very calm and pleasant night in the dark valley.16.3 miles, 2210 ft gain.Day 7:Slept in a bit since I didn't have far to go, at nearly the last of my food, and was off. Not far down the trail I ran into a deer hunter with a tricked out bow, the first person I'd seen in 36 hours. I moved on, finishing off the easy trail and was surprised to find lots of tire tracks the the White River trailhead. Rolled my eyes at the people who had surely driven around the barricade only to find the further I walked the better the road became. Then I spotted construction equipment tracks. The road was being repaired! About halfway down I saw a pickup truck pull off to the side and a guy in an orange shirt unload some pipes. He said they'd been working since Tuesday and would be finished by the end of this week, though it was up to the FS when they reopen the road. He offered me a ride back but I was determined to do the whole trip on foot.Reached my car and was happy to clean off in the river and change into clean clothes. Then even hungry enough for a burger at Zeke's in Goldbar! Spotted several thru hikers hitching east to Leavenworth at Stevens Pass but nobody looking for a westbound ride.6.4 miles, 455 ft gain.Great trip! Seven days of high ridge walking, marmots, huckleberries, thru hikers, solitude, views, and just a good time. I will do this trip again, though next time I'll tack on an extra day for more flexibility. \u00a0Ended up with 112 miles total over 7 days!Full photo set on the FlickR link below.", "date": "Aug 26, 2017"}, {"comment": "This work party began at the top of a chair lift. \u00a0One group headed north towards the parking area while our other group headed south. \u00a0The South bound group encountered overgrown bushes and tread that has seen better days. \u00a0This is \u00a0trail where stock is allowed but it seems too narrow for stock to me. \u00a0We had time to cut back some brush, clear a few drain dips and make space in a culvert. \u00a0There is still plenty of work to be done here.We met numerous hikers on trail - most were doing the Snoqualmie to Stevens section but I didn't speak with everyone. \u00a0The day was lovely, views of mountains and valleys abound! \u00a0I'll have to hike this section when I have more time.\u00a0", "date": "Aug 19, 2017"}, {"comment": "7 year old Buddy Boy's longest backpack to date - 3 nights and 25 miles including a side trip. Big success!!The first day was smoky but the incoming storm soon blew out the dust and the views cleared. We made the pass in 2 hours and climbed up to the Doubtful Lake overlook after lunch. Beautiful flowers especially lupine and Sitka valerian on the route. After lunch under a clearing sky we hoofed down to beautiful Pelton Basin camp.We had rain the first night and second day but soon dried out under clear skies and had beautiful sunny weather by the second night.From Pelton to Basin Creek is a steep and long descent. Fortunately the NPS has cleared the brush on this area. The Doubtful waterfall crossing is pretty easy this time of year and provides an amazing backdrop to the wild hanging valley all around. Basin Creek camp is brushy but private and we had it all to ourselves.The NPS was busily clearing brush from the switchbacks up to Pelton Basin all the way down past Cottonwood camp. We heard the trail to Horseshoe basin remains very brushy but alas, because of the rain we did not have a chance to make it up there.Day three from Basin to Park Creek was sunny and dry. We stopped for a couple hours at the Flat Creek trail crossing for some swimming\u00a0and sunning before finishing up at Park Creek Camp. Again, we were the only campers there (Park creek is after the PCT turn off). Terrible flies til the sun went behind the hills\u00a0at which point they mostly disappeared.From Park Creek to High Bridge is a bit of a long slog without tons of views, but it does make up for it with huge quantities of huckleberries. Apparently PCTers are too busy hiking 20 miles per day to eat berries. Their loss, our gain!We made it to High Bridge in time for the 12:30 shuttle and celebrated with lunch at the Pastry Shop in Stehekin. Great way to end a great trip.Buddy Boy is a stud hiker for 7!There are plentiful flies in spots on the Cascade Pass trail but none at the pass itself. The flies reasserted themselves in Pelton Basin Camp and quite voraciously in Park Creek Camp until sundown. We had a few skeeters but nothing serious.", "date": "Aug 12, 2017"}, {"comment": "We did a circumnavigation of Glacier Peak from August 11 to August 19, 2017. Doing a loop around Glacier Peak has been on my list for a number of years. After our Pasayten trip was cancelled due to the Diamond Creek fire (right along our route), we created a Plan B trip for the Lake Chelan-Sawtooths. Due to the smoky conditions in Central WA, we then created a Plan C, which was this trip. This was a perfect Plan C and I'm really glad we did it.To complete this loop you need to choose whether or not to take the mostly unmaintained White River trail (brushy, wash outs, downed trees) or the Indian Creek trail (periodically maintained but very, very brushy). We opted to take the Indian Creek trail and begin our trip with getting the brushiest trail out of the way. My party of three all felt like starting with Indian Creek was a good idea...get it out of the way. It's slow travel due to the brush and a little route-finding through brushy and grassy areas and with nine days worth of food, our packs were already heavy. The Indian Creek trail is Type 2 fun. We hiked it on a very hot and somewhat smoky day. There's also a 2 mile road walk to the trailhead...it goes by quickly. You'll finish the trip via the White River trail (the maintained portion) and the road walk, but again, it goes by quickly.This route also includes a high route up and over High Pass out of Buck Creek Pass. While there is a bootpath, it is not a maintained trail, and it disappears in places. We did not have any problems with this section as we had a bluebird skies sort of day. If you have not done a high route or cross-country travel, this section could be intimidating. Having experience with high routes and cross-country travel would be highly recommended.A circumnavigation of Glacier Peak is similar to Mt. Rainier's Wonderland Trail, albeit more rugged and remote. Throw in an extremely brushy trail and a high route and it takes this loop up a few notches in the need for experience in this sort of terrain. This loop is also highlighted in Mike Woodmansee's book \"Trekking Washington\" if you want more details.Day 1 was spent entirely on Indian Creek plus the two mile road walk. We made it to the campsite just in the trees after a beautiful meadow. It's the last campsite before Indian Pass and you can get water in the meadow. This campsite is marked on the updated Green Trails map (2015 update I think). It has spots for a couple of tents.Day 2 finished off Indian Creek, hooked up with the PCT and stayed on the PCT through White and Red passes and down to Baekos Creek. This is an incredibly scenic day. I love the White and Red pass areas. You do a lot of traversing this day and not a ton of elevation gain. Baekos Creek has a couple campsites and the creek itself is a good size (complete with footbridge to cross).Day 3 had us continuing north on the PCT to Mica Lake. This was the only crummy weather day. It was socked in for most of the day and it rained on us for a handful of hours. The PCT in this section is very remote and has some downed trees over the trail. Nothing impassable though.As we neared Fire Creek Pass we came across a gentleman who had gotten soaked and was starting to show signs of hypothermia. We helped set up his tent, got him in and situated into dry, warm clothes and on his way to regaining heat. This was the first time any of us had experienced an on-trail situation where we needed to help someone having difficulty. We were happy to know that our knowledge of what to do when someone is showing signs of hypothermia was sufficient and incredibly useful in this situation. I felt like we did everything right in this situation and helped someone who could have had a much worse outcome. We later learned that it took this gentleman all night to warm up but by the next morning, the sun was shining and he was on his way to drying out his gear and person and in good spirits.On this day by the time we got down to Mica Lake, it was so socked in that we walked past the lake, reached the outlet and realized we had walked past the lake. We backtracked and stood a foot from the lake -- we could only see the edge of the very blue water...that's how socked in it was. We decided to drop a little lower in case the wind picked up as Mica is very exposed. Dropping down we found ourselves spending the night at a camp location that had a big USFS Darrington Ranger District trail crew. They had been stationed at this camp since mid-July and were heading out three days after our visit there. And they did an amazing amount of work, clearing out and brushing the trail north from Mica Lake down to Milk Creek and up to the next ridge. Thank you FS crew!!Day 4 continued on the PCT in some of the most remote areas along the PCT in Washington. And it's just beautiful. We ended up camping at Vista Camp, which has a stunning view of the Suiattle drainage over to Miner's Ridge and nearby peaks. Due to its location, we shared this camp with a couple thru-hikers, which was interesting. Note that this camp has a toilet too. It's not marked with a sign, but there is a freshly brushed bootpath heading right out of the campsite (kind of near the fire ring) and heading slightly downhill. This is also a dry campsite. We found water by traveling back the way we came on the PCT a couple switchbacks and took a short side path to a draw where a small creek was flowing.Day 5 continued on the PCT and onto the rerouted PCT and new bridge crossing the Suiattle. The new trail goes through some stunning old growth forest and should not be missed. The new bridge is impressive -- and long! It is a work of art and is situated on bedrock...hopefully to forever stay in place this time! We camped at Miner's Creek, which has multiple campsites and a short cascading waterfall.Day 6 took us from the PCT onto the Buck Creek Pass trail. This day goes up to Middle Ridge, then down and then up to Buck Creek Pass. Nothing too eventful other than we campsite at the pass and took our dinner back up to the trail to watch the clouds fly past Glacier Peak. Spotted a black bear on the side of Flower Dome munching on huckleberries.Day 7 was the High Pass high route day out of Buck Creek Pass. We woke up to low clouds, but fortunately they burned off by the time we neared High Pass. We did use ice axes and microspikes for the short, moderately steep climb up to High Pass. We were happy to have them...and since we carried them all that way for this one crux spot, we felt compelled to use them. This is just a stunning route. So much gawking occurred and so many photos were taken. We headed down to the Napeequa, took a bit of time to locate the Napeequa River trail (entry onto the trail entailed a bushwhack through some slide alder that had taken over the trail due to a slide). We ended up camping at Louis Creek. A very scenic campsite due to it's location with a view of the cascading falls on Louis Creek.Day 8 took us a few miles down the Napeequa trail to the Boulder Pass trail. To get to the Boulder Pass trail you must ford the Napeequa River. The river has some glacial silt to it so it's not always easy to see your footing. There aren't a lot of boulders in this spot of the river. Two of us kept our shoes on while one switched to their campshoes for the crossing. I am 5'2\" and the water came up to my crotch...the current is moderate here and having trekking poles was very helpful. We did notice (after the fact) that a couple yards downstream looked like a shallower crossing...you can find ways to make this crossing easier, but it is a true river crossing. Boulder Pass is a place to spot and enjoy. We took a long lunch break here. There's campsites below the pass and at the pass. The views of the Napeequa valley are impressive from here. The Napeequa valley is beautiful. We ended up camping on the south side of Boulder Pass at the basin below the pass.Day 9 was all downhill, finishing up the Boulder Creek trail and on to the White River trail and back to the car. There's a primitive campground where the road is blocked due to the washout. It's a good spot to stay the night before you start or upon ending your trip.The mileage for this trip was a bit over 100 miles and the elevation gain was more than 24,000 feet I think.\u00a0\u00a0", "date": "Aug 11, 2017"}, {"comment": "The Suiattle River Rd #26 is in good condition with only a few pot holes and dips to watch out for. \u00a0My small Ford C-Max had no problem but it's a long and dusty drive. \u00a0The Suiattle Trail is gentle and in excellent condition. \u00a0A nice map at the trail head shows camp sites along the way. \u00a0There are some really nice ones about 6 miles in along both sides of Canyon Creek. \u00a0Joining the PCT at the Suiattle Trail junction heading north on the PCT to Suiattle Pass, there are a handful of blow downs along the trail prior to Buck Pass Trail junction, one requiring me to take off my pack. \u00a0It would be difficult for a horse. \u00a0Between Suiattle Pass and descending Agnus Creek all the way to High Bridge and Stehekin, the PCT is in fantastic condition with evidence of recent trail work, no snow, plenty of water at seasonal crossings. \u00a0At the ford of Agnus creek there is a wide log just downstream which, with my short legs, I had no trouble crossing. \u00a0If you decide to ford it\u2019s only about knee deep or less and not fast moving. \u00a0The huckleberries are ripe and very plentiful as you get closer to High bridge. \u00a0The spring flowers have mostly faded but late summer asters, monkey flowers and blue gentian are all at their best. \u00a0Despite the smoke the views are still impressive and Agnus gorge a sight to behold. \u00a0You pass the 2015 Agnus Creek fire location and can see how it came straight down to the creek. \u00a0Retracing my steps for the return allowed a different view of the creek and mountains. \u00a0If you take the Miner\u2019s Ridge Trail at the Suiattle Pass Junction it is actually 1 mile shorter than taking the PCT back, plus, you can avoid the blow downs. \u00a0The Miner\u2019s Ridge is definitely a path less taken and is in excellent condition, no blow downs and an easy traverse (not a sole around). \u00a0If you had a horse or want to avoid the downed obstacles or like your elevation gain/loss all at once, this is the path to take. \u00a0The switch backs down to the PCT are at a good grade and in excellent condition. \u00a0For a nice side trip, go to Image Lake or take the PCT south at the Suiattle Trail Junction, cross the bridge and go about a mile to some GIGANTIC cedars and fir trees. \u00a0Retrace your steps back to the trail head. \u00a0It\u2019s about 78 miles total.", "date": "Aug 5, 2017"}],

Day 1 was up the Clear Lost trail, then the Coyote Trail to the PCT, camping along the PCT just East of Elk Pass. Day two started with a blustery side trip to the Summit of Old Snowy Mountain, then along the PCT NE to White Pass as the winds picked up, the temperatures dropped and the clouds moved in throughout the day. I reached the truck at White Pass after 8:00 pm, just as the first drops of rain started falling. This hike has a short shuttle - I parked the truck at White Pass then biked about 4 miles West to Clear Lost trailhead, where I hid the bike in the woods.Trails: Clear Lost and Coyote trails were in reasonably good condition, with minimal snow and only a dozen or so easy downed trees on Coyote Trail between Beaver Bill Creek and Elk Pass.From Elk Pass to Old Snowy summit there\u2019s a lot of snow drifted onto the trail, in many places it\u2019s deep, steep and hard packed.On the PCT North from Elk Pass to White Pass, there was some easy snow in higher areas of the trail, with two exceptions: 1) There\u2019s steep drifted snow just North of Elk Pass as the trail cuts across the North face of the ridge. 2) There\u2019s steep drifted snow the first few hundred yards North from \u201cShoe Lake Pass\u201d at 6600+ feet, near Hogback Mountain.

Intermittent water from Lost Lake to Beaver Bill Creek and half way to Packwood Saddle. After 15 minutes of searching I could not find the Spring at Packwood Saddle, so I continued up to Elk Pass and half a mile NE along the PCT to a perennial water source there.

The road to the TH is barricaded about 3.5 miles from the TH. The road is in good condition and an easy hike or bike to the TH at the boundary of the Goat Rocks wilderness. The old campground at the TH\u00a0appears decommissioned but has nice sites and a good creek for drinking water.\u00a0From the TH I attempted to find\u00a0the \"old army trail\" to McCall Basin. I won't elaborate too much on this since I never found anything more than elk paths that went where I was going and may have been the old trail. Following the braided North Fork Tieton River channels through miles of old growth Cedar and then climbing around numerous cataracts to McCall Basin was beautiful and immensely rewarding. I ascended the ridge on the South side of upper McCall basin and scrambled along it (class 2/3) SW to the summit of Old Snowy Mountain. It was about five hours of magnificent cross-country travel to this point during which I saw no one even though the parking area was \"packed\". There were 10 vehicles which is the most I have ever seen there.The summit of Old Snowy was misty and very windy. I was glad to have a down jacket and wished I had thought to bring gloves. I had to fold up my poles and put my hands in my pockets. I followed the PCT North from Old Snowy for a few miles to the Jct with the N. Fork Tieton Trail at Tieton Pass and descended this trail back to my car. This exposed section is my favorite part of the PCT in WA. Truly a must do. All trails were in excellent condition. Ran into a few friendly through hikers and hunters but overall a pretty quiet day.<3 the Goat Rocks!", "date": "Sep 10, 2017"}, {"comment": "- Drive was easy. 3 of us met at Cultus Creek Campground the night before, no problems finding it, road in good condition.

As one of my antisocial hikes for the season, I needed a shuttle up to my trailhead at Crest Horse Camp.\u00a0 So I put a \u201cgig\u201d up on the jobs section of Craigslist, Columbia Gorge area, asking for a ride from Cascade Locks up the road 26 miles. A few flakey weirdos answered my ad but it didn\u2019t pan out, until some guy named Dean (name changed to protect privacy) texted me and said he lived in Carson. Said, \u201cSure, I\u2019ll shuttle you up there for $40. I\u2019m not doing anything that day.\u201dGot to Cascade Locks on a Wednesday afternoon and parked on the main drag. Sat under the bridge for a while, talking to the tribal folks who were operating the fruit stands nearby. They told me that they will hook up PCT hikers who stop by their tables. Cherries mainly. And peaches so juicy you have to lean forward and stand back as you eat them.Eventually Dean shows up in a little red beater, and I will admit I did have a moment of hesitation; he looked a little wild-eyed. Actually, he looked a lot like me, in 20 years, if I decide to take a certain path in life. He was skinny like me, had the same pattern of sun damage as me. He was missing some teeth (I\u2019ve had some dental misfortunes in recent years), and was limping around in a hard orthopedic boot on account of a broke 5th metatarsal. When he told me that I swatted his arm in delight\u2014I\u2019d broken the same bone. We drove across the Bridge of the Gods and I surreptitiously took a photo of Dean and me and sent it off to loved ones in case he decided to murder me. He didn\u2019t though. Instead we talked about local history and Dean\u2019s various money-making endeavors (fixing up and reselling cars and various heavy equipment, collecting scrap metal, etc.). We passed through Carson, out of cell phone range, and on to Panther Creek Road. \u201cI like it back here,\u201d said Dean, as we drove through mature second-growth near Panther Creek. Dean told me about the massive old diesel generator he\u2019d recently taken apart and made $200 in copper scrap. And about the two-ton trailer he\u2019d recently scored a deal on. We passed a Chevy Volt parked at a trailhead and Dean said, \"Elon Musk. The world needs great thinkers like him!\" He dropped me off at Crest Horse Camp with a handshake. I told him I\u2019d share his number with some trail angels in the area; hikers regularly want to bypass this section of the trail anyhow.Heading south from Crest Horse Camp, you skirt the western edge of Big Lava Bed, a massive jumble a rock looming alongside the trail. Lodgepole pine and other true fir of some sort have done a pretty good job of colonizing this formation. At PCT 2204 (see Halfmile\u2019s PCT maps for mileage), a PVC pipe emerges from the trailside, and water was flowing just fine here as of this writing (I doubt this source dries up). I did not look for the spring at 2202, but did pass through a moist area here. A bit of a climb up the side of Big Huckleberry Mountain where there are a couple of unmapped campsites near the top with glorious views of Mount Adams and Hood. I then started a long, truly waterless descent and stopped for the night near a road at 2196. A couple of Washington PCT section hikers there told me how they\u2019d almost gotten heat exhaustion on the climb out of Cascade Locks. The next morning I continued to hike downhill, through a series of switchbacks to Panther Creek. Hikers heading up were grumbling; that is a really tough section. Panther Creek itself was lovely. By mid-day I had crossed the Wind River Highway. A few locals were looking for semi-precious stones in the Wind River. I walked past the southern flank of Bunker Hill and into a big prairie, through some private land. Came across a large container on the trail with a note reading: \u201cHungry? Grab a bran muffin!! (or three). Hope you are having a beautiful hike, whatever your destination. Your friends at AMC August Camp.\u201d Met several section and thru-hikers (some southbound, some northbound) at Trout Creek, where I went for a swim. Most of them were stopping there to camp, but I kept going, putting in another 5 miles or so, climbing out of the Wind River/Trout Creek drainage.\u00a0 I stopped for the night around 2180, where the trail crosses an old, seemingly unused forest road (NF-412, Sunset Hemloack Rd) southeast of Mowich Butte.The next morning (Friday) I scrambled up a side trail near 2179 to find an incredible open outcropping (here: 45.793395, -121.993367) with views south to Mount Hood and everything in between. I was able to get cell service here and check in. The trail then descends into the Rock Creek area\u2014a deep, lush canyon, and in many ways of the highlight of this section of the PCT. A feeder stream of the North Fork of Snag Creek cascades across the trail at one point, where every major fern species in the PNW seemed to exist within a 100-meter diameter. There\u2019s a large campsite along North Fork Snag Creek (approx. here: 45.766158, -122.025535), and after crossing Red Bluff Rd, you come to Snag Creek, then eventually the footbridge over Rock Creek proper. This is a gorgeous spot, with a nice campsite and an open, wide area of the creek perfect for swimming (located approx. here: 45.766619, -122.038141). If you are headed southbound, fill up on water here!\u00a0 And take a lot of it (I took almost a gallon, and drank almost all of it); there will likely be no more water for 11 hot miles. I met a couple of SoBo hikers here\u2014Eric and Leafy\u2014who were planning to put in a 30+ mile day to make it into Cascade Locks that night. I have no doubt they did it; they were in fantastic and stinky shape. \u201cSmell ya later,\u201d I said as we parted ways. \u00a0The climb out of Rock Creek was not all that bad. The next several miles were through quiet, middle-elevation second-growth forest. Still pretty shaded, but occasionally opening up. Huckleberries galore. As of this trip, a two mile section of the PCT was closed due to an approximately 200 meter area of logging along the trail just south of 2168. It was Friday afternoon and there were no loggers in site\u2026the detour takes you on a gravel road, and adds a mile to your hike\u2026So, you know\u2026do whatever you think is right. By about 2166 or so, the Columbia and Table Mountain came into view. Things really started opening here. The trail get rocky, hot, dusty, and exposed. Thankfully, there was a breeze, but I have no trouble seeing how northbound hikers could get exhausted and overheated here. I eventually stopped at Gilette Lake, having put in about 22 miles for the day. Gilette Lake was full of campers, toilet paper everywhere, and the occasional scurrying critter. I don\u2019t recommend staying here.The next morning I crossed over Bridge of the Gods, high-fiving a passing motorist, and went straight to the Marine Park Campground, paid $5 for a shower, and got a beer and a meatball hero at Thunder Island Brewing (which has a great little interpretive display about PCT hiking and exhorts customers to show thru-hikers some trail magic). What a great trip!\u00a0 52 miles in 3 days, and I didn\u2019t need to use a single drop of repellent in what is supposed to be a terrible mosquito season! Not on this mostly dry section of trail.

It really wasn't that steep or difficult. \u00a0We intended to hike the 52 miles at a pace of 10 miles per day, but we did 15 miles on day one and day two, without too much effort. \u00a0I have heard that many through-hikers find a way to bypass the first 30 miles by doing some Forest Service roads, but I recommend the trail. \u00a0It is a pretty easy hike, and being in the woods is very pretty. \u00a0There are only views on this hike as you get close to Crest Camp, which was day 4 for us. \u00a0Water: \u00a0The half-mile maps are very accurate where water supply is mentioned. \u00a0And some of the \"seasonal streams\" may not be there by August, I'm sure. \u00a0From about mile 6 to mile 17 there is NO water. \u00a0We camped at mile 15, and that campsite is on a ridge with gorgeous views on both sides. \u00a0The tent site is sheltered from wind; \u00a0I highly recommend it. \u00a0But, it is a dry camp. \u00a0Only 2 miles further down the trail to a water supply. \u00a0It's off the trail about 20 yards, but through an easy clearing and easy to find (especially because you will be motivated!). \u00a0Day 2 was 15 miles to Trout Creek camp. Beautiful site for about 3-5 tents, and water. \u00a0(Btw, on day 2 Rock Creek is a beautiful spot to spend some time for lunch, or camp.) Day 3, from Trout Creek to CS 2183, we had water up until mile 7, at Panther Creek. \u00a0Then 3 miles, uphill, to camp - dry camp. \u00a0Then, 8 MILES to water the next day. \u00a0So from Panther Creek, there is NO WATER for 11 miles, which is not noted on the half-mile maps.Terrain was easy, we had some blowdowns. \u00a0I'm 5'3\" and had to take my pack off twice. \u00a0Lots of bushwacking on day 1 and 2, but the trail was wide and flat and no hazards that were dangerous. \u00a0Saw scat (bear and cougar?) but only saw a skunk for wildlife. \u00a0Great trip. \u00a0I would not bypass it. \u00a0Hike it!", "date": "Jun 28, 2017"}],

We camped at Rainier so were greeted with the early morning light and were the first onto trails in the morning. It is not easy to do this as RVs and car camping are not allowed. This fact is not immediately made apparent by the park service. However with back-country permit in hand and the right equipment it was a spectacular night.The clouds cleared midway through the night and the moon light was spectacular on Rainier's south face. The Tatoosh range to the south provided gloriously rugged lines of rock and snow capturing the crisp winter sun. The skies overhead were clear all day but to the south a myriad of cloud formations crept across the sky.The Skyline trail does a large loop around the Paradise Meadows area beginning by the ranger station. Tracks however head off higgledy-piggledy in all directions. It is best to use GPS or have a good capacity to read a map and understand the complexities of winter navigation and avalanche assessment.We enjoyed the early morning solitude and quiet. Only once we got above Glacier Vista and started on towards Panorama Point were we interrupted from our day dream. The mid morning sun started to warm the upper slope's trees and we were bombarded with snow and ice cascading down the slope. Having no helmets we had to scurry of onto a ridge to avoid the onslaught.We did not gain the upper ridge where the Skyline trail traverses eastwards. Rather we traversed the slopes below the ridge staying away from obvious avalanche slide areas. Rejoining the Skyline Trail we headed up to Sluiskin Falls before calling it a day.Today there was no real need for snow shoes.

Brought microspikes but did not take them out.Based on trip reports from 13 days ago, I thought that there would be a lot more snow, but in the parking lot at Paradise it was snow free. I went up in a clockwise direction. Tons of skiers (including my partner) headed up to Camp Muir... but pretty much snow-free on the trail from the parking lot until Glacier View. This part of the trail is a highway with all the people, so even snowy parts are well-trodden and if you are careful your feet won't get wet.

The snow was soft enough to kick very good steps. Not many people on the east side of the loop, but a few. The snow is patchy- no snow for awhile, more later on- and below the junction with the Golden Gate trail, there were old wind-blown tracks but no one had been through recently, and the snow was deeper, so I gave up on keeping my feet dry and postholed through calf-to-ankle deep snow but it was pretty obvious where to go, and again, it opened up to patches of dry trail every so often. The lower stream crossing just before the Van Trump memorial is tricky if you want to keep your feet dry, but it's not deep, and honestly the cars are only 2 miles away at this point.

The days were long and hard, and if I could go back, I would choose a\u00a0less strenuous hike for my first time camping. The exhaustion at the end of each (9-10 hour) day made it nearly impossible to enjoy the beauty of everything around me as I wanted to. For a seasoned hiker/backpacker, this is probably the perfect 3-4 day trip and checks off everything on the list (which is why we chose it!) ridge lines, alpine meadows, 360 views, streams, bridges, lake... the list goes on!Day 1 - After getting permits from the ranger station, we drove the 30ish minutes and started at East Bank Trailhead, hiked the first few miles on the road to the Canyon Creek Trailhead since we read online the conditions between the two were pretty bad (great choice), then hopped on the trail from there. Day 1 was seriously built up with the elevation gain, and it was a difficult day. We reached the shelter, and by the time we set up camp it was getting dark. A deer showed up while we were cooking, and stayed near our tent\u00a0all night long.Day 2 - Still some pretty serious elevation gain (and loss) all throughout day 2. This was, hands down, more difficult than day 1 -- so be prepared when starting out and make sure to fill up water at the shelter, as the next source wasn't for a few miles this time of year. The scree slope was the hardest part of the whole trip for me (we were going down it during the eclipse which was pretty awesome, though). The goal was to get to the 6,982 ft dome, but we came in short by amount a mile, and it ended up being the best decision we made. We camped just before the final ascent to the dome, by ourselves, at a\u00a0gorgeous, open, eerily quiet spot\u00a0before\u00a0making the ascent to the Dome early on Day 3.Day 3 - We started hiking up to the dome for about 30ish minutes before reaching the top and the 360 degree views. It truly was breathtaking! By this time, the other groups that camped there had descended so we had the entire dome to ourselves and were able to take in the beauty of it all (and all the pictures we wanted!). The way down was pretty quick and not\u00a0strenuously steep. Before we knew it, we had reached the lake, had lunch, and then continued another 3ish miles to Rainbow Point. Highly recommend Rainbow... dock, lake, picnic table, and beach area! It was a peaceful, warm night.Day 4 - The last 9.5 miles back to the car at East Bank were not difficult, but seemed to last forever at the same time. We made it to the car around 1pm, then enjoyed Annie's Pizza, Cascadian Farms ice cream, and beer at Birdsview Brewing that night in Concrete to reward ourselves!We saw plenty of bees/flies, not many\u00a0mosquitoes, lots of ground squirrels, a few brown ptarmigans, and a deer that had zero fear of humans near the shelter. The weather was 75-85 during the days, dropping probably into the 40's at night.Overall, this was an unforgettable trip and the experience was one for the books. The hike was much harder than we both expected, and another group on the trail agreed that the difficulty was\u00a0more than we bargained for.

I originally intended it as a four day, three-night trip but went a little faster than planned. The weather forecast was for hot weather, approaching 100 degrees towards the end of my time. I didn\u2019t find that the heat was really a problem though as it was a little cooler in the hills than in the low country.Day one\u2019s intended destination was Devil\u2019s Park. Started from the Canyon Creek trailhead off of HWY 20 at 7 am, hoping to avoid the heat of the day. The trail was easy to follow although a bit rough in spots. This trail is not maintained by the forest service but the \u201croughness\u201d mostly means that the trail is overgrown and crowded in spots. Most of the overgrown portions only come up to the knees however so it did not impede travel much at all. You do consistently gain elevation so expect to earn your miles. While not exceedingly steep, there is no mistaking that you are heading uphill quickly.The first bit of navigation comes with the intersection of the Jackita Ridge trail and the branch off to Crater Mt. As others have noted, this intersection is not marked and the most obvious trail is the one that leads to Crater Mt. I went about 20 yards down this trail before I got the feeling that I had missed something. I backtracked to the creek and sure enough, found the right trail leading off on the other side of the creek. The trail is clear but unless you actually go down to the water and look for it, you may miss it.Once you gain the ridge and enter McMillans Park, the beauty of the area really comes alive. You begin to see the mountains and the flowers in the alpine meadows. This is what you hike this trail for. After the steady up hill of the first several miles it feels good to pass through this relatively flat area. There are a lot of mosquitos in this area however so I kept moving to avoid being eaten alive.I reached the Devils Park shelter at roughly noon. I spent about 40 minutes resting and checking out this area. There is a good water source and the flowers are abundant. I ultimately decided not to stay here for the night, just because I had so much day left. The next several miles of trail gain elevation and take you on to Jackita Ridge. The views continually get better and open up more of the cascades for your viewing pleasure.\u00a0The next several miles are a pleasure to hike. The main difficult spot was the scree field. It is a steep downhill with very loose rock. This area is a slow down no matter how you approach it.I decided that I was going to try to reach Devils Pass for the night and if I had enough daylight, Devils Dome. Unfortunately the last two miles before Devils Pass are hellish when tackled at the end of the day. It is a very steep, rough downhill and equally steep uphill on the other side. There was a beautiful campsite two miles before Devils Pass and I wish I had stayed there. I reached Devils Pass after 17.5 miles and over 7K of elevation gain and almost 4K of elevation loss. The bugs were really bad and I spent any time before sleep in my tent to avoid them. I did not find any water near Devils Pass but water had been plentiful throughout the day so I had plenty.Day 2 started at 6 and I was on the trail by 7. The 4 miles or so to Devils Dome are very pretty and the trail takes you right to the edge of some serious drop offs. The trail never feels unsafe but you definitely want to pay attention. Reached Devils dome just after 8. I definitely want to come back in the future and camp a night on top. It has many spots to drop a tent and affords 360 degree views of the cascades.I spent about 35 minutes on top before heading down the trail. There is a water source just a little ways down from the dome that should be consistent throughout the summer.The trip down to the valley is a fairly gradual downhill, in fact I wondered at times if I was ever going to get down to the lake. You eventually do though. The views of Jack Mt. continue to change throughout the hike until you eventually say goodbye for good and drop in to the lower trees.I reached my destination of Rainbow Point campground sometime around 4. The trail to the camp takes you right along Ross Lake and is very nice. A totally different view than the mountains but a nice change. The path at times is cut right out of the rock and is really spectacular. The campground is really nice with three sites that each has two tent sites. I took a swim in the lake and just spent some time relaxing and reading. There were virtually no bugs to speak of which was a welcome change. The temperature in the valley was much warmer than in the hills so it was a very hot sleep.I hit the trail at 6 the next morning, hoping to be back to the car before noon. The East Bank trail is very flat so I was able make very good time. Most of the trail is through forest so there wasn\u2019t a whole lot of incentive to go slow. The bugs were back once you got a way from the lake so beware. The only elevation gain is over hidden hand pass but it is a very gradual gain and loss.The worst part of the whole trail was the last mile. From the East Bank trailhead you follow the river, which is beautiful, to the canyon creek trailhead. There is a sign at one point that says this 2.5 miles is maintained by the Skagit Audubon club but I am guessing that they haven\u2019t had a trail day in a while. There are multiple downed trees crossing the trail that you have to fight through. This is one top of crossing through boulders and brush so thick you just have to trust that you are on the trail. Not fun. All good, and bad, things come to an end though and it was a great feeling to see the footbridge signifying the return to where I started.Overall this is a great trail. Lots of views. Plenty of camping options for whatever length of days you want to hike.", "date": "Jul 30, 2017"}],

Some of the party came out at Chinook Pass on Day 3, and the rest carried on for two more days to exit at the Norse Peak Trailhead (near Crystal Mountain), where we stationed a car.Overview: The trail is easy to follow (well-marked), well-graded, dusty, and had a variety of scenery to keep us feeling satiated. We shared the trail with many through-hikers, and had one character spend the night in our campsite. Berries were at a peak- ripe, delicious and plentiful. Wildflowers were past their prime, but we could see the remnants of what must have been fields popping with color. Luckily bugs were also past their peak, and we only had a random mosquito or bee try to follow us along. We passed a variety of lakes, mudholes, ponds, and streams. We thoroughly enjoyed the unfolding scenery as we approached Chinook Pass. We had the Half Mile PCT app for the first 3 days, and found it very helpful for tracking\u00a0mileage and finding landmarks, lakes, spur trails and campsites. Wildfires are questionable in the Norse Peak area, so check the PCT closures site\u00a0and the Incident Information System for updates.\u00a0Day 1: White Pass to creek campsite (marked on the Half Mile PCT app as WACS2305 large creek, wooden bridge, several campsites) at mile 2304.8. Besides the ponds and lakes, there was no water running in the creeks up to this point (not even outflow streams from the lakes). The trail is almost completely flat for this section, going in and out of forest, passing a multitude of ponds, mudholes and lakes. The most scenic campsites were at Deer Lake, Pipe Lake and Snow Lake. Sand Lake and Buesch Lake were decent, too. Our campsite at the wooden bridge was large and flat, and the water was running brisk and cold. We stopped at Sand Lake for the eclipse! Total mileage ~12.Day 2: Creek campsite to Two Lakes. This day starts with a gentle descent towards Bumping Creek. Water is flowing again, and the forest is luscious. The Bumping Creek was cold, but not too hard to cross with water shoes and poles (one of us braved the log, but the rest opted to ford). We met Dora the through-hiker on the other side and chatted briefly before starting the climb up Crag Mountain. The views get better as you rise above Fish, Buck and Crag Lake. The trail became quite exposed and hot in the early afternoon, so we rested for lunch in the shade before reaching a great view point just before entering the Rainier NP boundary. You get your first views of Rainier here, and we loved watching the white cap come\u00a0in and out of view behind trees. Also the tip of St. Helens was barely viewable through the haze. We carried on, munching berries along the way, passed One Lake on the right, and found the signed trail for Two Lakes. It's a steep .3 mile down to the lake, with two nice waterfront campsites. The creek is dry, so we filtered from the lake, also enjoying a nice swim. Through-hikers had to go around to the campsite beyond the meadow, one coming down by headlamp around 9pm. Bats came out at dusk. ~8 milesDay 3: Two Lakes to Chinook Pass. This day boasted the best overall views. We could see Mt Rainier, St Helens, and Mt Adams as we coasted around the slope toward American Lake. The trail was a little up, then mostly flat and down, passing by lovely Anderson Lake and eventually the most scenic Dewey Lake. This lake boasts the turquoise color we look for in alpine lakes, and had many swimmable beaches, lake-side trail, and nice campsites. We met our day-hiking friends there who brought us a restock and took our backpacking couple\u00a0out from Chinook Pass. The Dewey Lake trail to Chinook Pass had blooming\u00a0flowers, scenic valley views, and a lovely little un-named lake as you descend to the pass. Highway 410 was closed heading east just beyond the trailhead for fires. After the restock, the three of us remaining headed on to Sheep Lake (after seeing a bear down in the meadow below 410!). The last 1.5 miles seemed long after an already epic day. Sheep Lake was quaint, and had some nice flat (and dusty) campsites. Fog rolled in that night. From Two Lakes ~8 miles to Chinook, then another 1.5\u00a0miles to Sheep Lake.Day 4: Sheep Lake to Basin Lake. We climbed up from Sheep Lake to Sourdough Gap. We were socked in with clouds, so couldn't see any views. We did see one marmot and 3 through-hikers! After the gap, we coasted down, and then across a slope sighting Placer Lake (and another bear down in lake basin!) and on over to Bear Gap (wind whistling and cold clouds moving through). We could see nothing through the fog, so continued on ridge-top and slope-walks, over Pickhandle Ridge and Panhandle Pass, saw a few firefighters having lunch at the Union Creek junction, and carried on (up and flat) until Scout Pass. Here you cross from western slope to east-facing slope, and the views began to clear. The terrain looks more arid along this ridge overlooking the Norse Peak Wilderness. We could barely see smoke beyond the ridge behind Basin Lake. Not having seen or heard anything about trail closures, we headed on to camp at Basin Lake. The sign for Basin Lake is laying in the scree, so we missed it the first time around and had to backtrack. The trail down to Basin is steep, dusty, and not well-graded. I swear it's longer than the signed 1/4 mile (the book says 1/2)! We saw lots of goat remnants, and were surprised to not see any actual goats (except for a few up on Norse Peak). There is an epic campsite on the far end of the lake with a wooden bench and lots of flat space. The outflow stream is a great water source right beside the campsite. That evening we heard planes and helicopters beyond the ridge managing the fire, and even had a helicopter scoop water out of Basin Lake several times right in front of us! Were we supposed to evacuate?? No way to know. The wind was blowing away and the air was clear of smoke that night, so we opted to stay. Cold winds that evening. 8-9 milesDay 5: Basin Lake to Norse Peak trailhead. That morning we had frost on our packs. We headed out early and watched smoke roll in as we left the lake basin. When we reached the PCT, heavy smoke was pouring into the area, and we were glad to be leaving! Our Green Trails map was slightly different than the printed map from Half Mile, and we were unable to find the first junction with the Norse Peak Trail that was apparently supposed to be heading west at the Crow Lake Junction. We headed on to Barnard Saddle to find unmarked trail 1161 heading off the PCT by Goat Lake. The trail looked well-used and was the only significant trail heading west/southwest from that area. We descended, noting Castle Rock above and Goat Lake below, so knew it was the right trail. There was an area of washed-out trail on the scree that had us taking off packs and scrambling to get across. Beyond the obvious switchback at about 1.8 miles, we passed a horse camp and started heading down. Soon enough we hit the junction with Norse Peak Trail (1191) and knew we were on track! Then we headed down, down, down to the trailhead by 1:30pm.

Six miles later, by 11 am, I had arrived at Lost Lake, after branching onto Lost Creek trail 1185 at 3 miles. I was just in time to see a couple across the lake go in the water for a long swim. After savoring a leisurely lunch at a pleasant lakeside campsite, I decided to test the water myself. After all, much of the lake was surrounded by a grassy shore of 30 feet or more and the lake bottom looked firm, not mucky. I quickly concluded that this is one of the best swimming lakes in the entire Cascades \u2013 and I\u2019ve had many years of experience.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0By noon I was headed up the trail to Noble Knob, 2 \u00bd miles and 2000\u2019 of elevation gain on a warm afternoon, but with good trail and gorgeous wild flowers in peak season. Met many hikers in from Corral Pass at the trail junction before the Knob. Glorious view from the rounded, old lookout site on top, from the Snoqualmie Peaks to the north, then south to the immense Emmons Glacier and Willis Wall on Mt Rainier. By around 3 pm I was headed to Corral Pass myself, contouring on Dalles Ridge trail 1184, shared with mountain bikes (just outside the Norse Peak Wilderness boundary), then back in the wilderness down to Echo Lake on trail 1176 again.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 At Corral Pass a trail crew assured me that logging out the trail below was on their list, yet the worst blow down was actually on the Arch Rock trail 1187 just after its start at Echo Lake. I found a good campsite here by the inlet creek but none of the easy lake access of Lost Lake; that is, brushy shore as far as the eye could see. Mosquitos here. Discovered the next morning that a local way trail continued to more campsites north along the eastern shore, but I was headed 2000\u2019 and 3 miles up 1187 to the PCT.\u00a0 I found some blowdown that needs clearing, mostly on the lower half of the trail, but overall the trail was in better shape than I had expected, well cleared and mostly easy to follow.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 A previous group had marked much of trail 1187 with red ribbons, though I found these unnecessary and was annoyed when a few of these were not actually on the trail. The only sketchy spots were in heavy forest litter at the beginning and then near the top in \u201cAirplane Meadow\u201d. At around 5700\u2019 there were some cairns to get me started on renewed track after it disappeared in the first small meadow. This tread climbs through narrow meadow next to Saddle Springs, then disappears again, along with the spring, upon entering the big meadow. Here a prominent sign in the center points the way to the PCT, along with an 1187 sign on the far edge, where good tread resumes. The route finding here may be a bit trickier on the way down, angling slightly to the right of the Echo Lake sign in the middle of the big meadow as you search for the springs, then again at the bottom, angling slightly uphill to the right from the last cairn through the small meadow to resumed tread in the forest. Never did see the airplane.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The PCT north 7.7 miles to the Maggie Creek trail was wonderful, as usual, with a trail crew taking out the last few blowdown through this stretch. Met several family groups, one fast and ultralight through hiker headed to Mexico, and a young woman headed to California, presumably after she figures out to lighten her 45lb pack. Even got a phone call from my sister (\u201cRavensong\u201d), likely aided by the communications towers on Raven Roost just to the east, just as I heard a real raven nearby. My \u201cHalfmile\u2019s PCT\u201d app worked marvelously, with plenty of water in Arch Rock creek, even as the forest itself was drier than normal.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Trail 1186 down to Maggie Creek was great, then the going got tough on the long contour over to the Greenwater River. This section is thick with blowdown, some old, some new, much worse than 1187. In fact there were few signs of hikers, with the final discouragement being a ford of the Greenwater River, though I found this was easy enough with hiking poles and camp sandals (Crocs). However the trail was well designed and well built, through beautiful forest\u2013 a good hike once logged out. The Greenwater River trail, of course, sees heavy usage, yet it too still has a few blowndown. For my final night I camped at 6 pm at a nice fisherman\u2019s campsite a couple of miles down river. Did about 17 \u00bd miles each day, my PCT average as \u201cOld Goat\u201d.", "date": "Jul 25, 2017"}],

It takes you through a big field, then up a gentle grade, dipping into a small canyon and up and back around to the cliff edge, all within the first mile.We weren't sure which way to go at the fork, but the lower path looked a little iffy (like it possibly ended over the cliff), so took the right hand, upper trail, which traverses across a part sandy, part sagebrush, occasionally rolling hilly plateau. The views are phenomenal from up here! The gently rolling river with the island and waterfowl, the stunning, striated cliffs of ancient sediment that vary wildly in shape, size and personality, the views of the Saddle Mountains to the north. And then the dunes come into view and you feel like you've stepped into the Sahara or Afghanistan - it's otherworldy.\u00a0The first dune is at about the 2 mile mark. We pulled ourselves up it (it's quite steep!) just to say we did, and for a bonus view. There was an interesting photo shoot going on involving a wedding veil, but we didn't hang around. Our goal was the farther dune, probably another mile on. It looked very intriguing, like a pyramid with its eastern side in shadow.Alas, the dog was thirsty and we were almost out of water so we didn't venture on. It was also getting late. Instead we looked for a way down to the enticing water, but it's impossible at this point along the way. Jazz Dog and I listened to the coyotes, presumably on the island, calling each other for awhile (magical) then the three of us headed back, striking down the dune until we eventually came upon the lower path we had seen on the way. We decided we preferred this way as it really takes you along the edge of the bluffs and you have a wonderful view of the rolling hills and interesting rock formations just below. We probably could have worked our way to the water this way (several animal trails just off the main trail), but it would have taken too long. Stopped at a cool little outcropping with a window for a picture and lunch, then tramped on till we met the main trail once again.There's a lovely reed-filled pond at the end of the walk. By the time we got back it was nearing sunset and the cacophony of bird sounds coming from this golden pond was glorious!\u00a0Such a beautiful, sunny, warm (61\u00b0), no wind day on a very easy, sandy, well maintained trail.\u00a0 A few yellow bells are showing their pretty heads!Just over 4 miles round trip. Another new favorite hike!Sat by the water and ate a snack as we watched the sun go down over the river. So peaceful.Discovered a neat cabin, a relic from the original White Bluffs settlement from the late 1800s, just on the other side of the parking lot as we were leaving. Bonus!\u00a0", "date": "Mar 11, 2018"}, {"comment": "Plenty of sunshine in the entire WA, but I was looking for some remote hike, so I decided to finally take this one out of my backpack. It\u2019s a long but enjoyable ride from Seattle and very worthy. I arrived at the trailhead by 1 pm, finding five more cars parked there.Intersection of SR-24 and the park road is well signed, so don\u2019t be afraid to miss the turn. Gravel road is in good condition and perfectly passable. Parking lot is not signed, but easy to see - I expected some shoulder parking, but it\u2019s actually a small area separated from the access road. There are no amenities, signage or other kind of information. WTA site suggests that the Discover Pass is required for this trail, but I haven\u2019t seen any posted requirement to display it neither at the TH nor on the entire length of the access road.The trail is nothing special right from the start. Things change when sand dunes come into view. They seem small at the beginning, but as you get closer, these sandy giants become overwhelming. It\u2019s hard to believe there is a piece of Sahara in the very heart of the evergreen state.There are two major dunes (not sure if that\u2019s a constant number). All other hikers were satisfied by the first dune and didn\u2019t proceed further, so it was pretty crowded. I couldn\u2019t find any established trail once I passed it, so I just followed a faint boot-and-paw path towards the second dune. It seems to be a build-your-own adventure. 1.5h after start, I reached the top of the second dune, which I had all to myself. Great feeling and unforgettable experience. I turned around there, so I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s a trail beyond the second dune. Return trip was shorter, and I reached the parking lot just before 3.30 pm, spending 2.5h on the trail.A few useful tips. Keep in mind that on the windy day the dune will devour your footprints promptly. Of course it\u2019s hard to get lost there, as the Columbia will always lead you back, but still there\u2019s a chance you won\u2019t find your track on the way back. Use caution when traversing the dunes. Each step causes a little sand slide. Close to the dune\u2019s ridge, where sand is loose, such a sand shift may be quite substantial. I don\u2019t believe it could bury a human, but I got my feet sucked into sand up to my ankles. Finally, bring water, lots of water. Even today, with temps in mid-60s and a gentle breeze, it was extremely hot on white reflecting dunes. I can\u2019t even imagine what it\u2019s like to be there in summer.", "date": "Mar 11, 2018"}, {"comment": "Being in the area I stopped by for a quick visit. The walk along the high bluffs above The Columbia is stunning on the way out to the dunes. I found the dunes less interesting though I only walked to the first one. Overall the walk is worthwhile.\u00a0Driving a few minutes down to the old townsite of White Bluffs where the old ferry crossing was is also interesting. The town was removed in 1943, including the cemetery, to make way for the Manhattan Project but one small structure remains.\u00a0", "date": "Mar 1, 2018"}],

This was my first visit to Guemes.I pulled up right as the boat was about to leave and ran on carrying my bike with the wheel still detached and balancing on my head. A few minutes later, we disembarked onto quiet Guemes Island. I hopped on my bike and followed the road along the shore, waving hello to the few couples I saw along the beach.Soon after, I hit the trailhead, visible from the street by the metal bike rack. I locked my bike up, though something tells me I probably didn't need to in this peaceful little community. An assortment of dog leashes and trekking poles hung at the trailhead, free for the public to use.\u00a0The trail meandered through the\u00a0forest\u00a0for a bit before the trees became a bit more sparse, giving way to views of blue skies and scenic vistas. A couple benches sit alongside the trail, providing a great spot to sit and take in the views. Soon I reached the summit,\u00a0affording nearly 360-degree views, and several more benches to relax on. There's a short loop trail that takes you to some different viewpoints - both of land and of water. I couldn't find trees suitable to hang my hammock, so I used my backpack as a pillowed and laid out on one of the benches for 20 minutes or so, soaking in the sunshine.From the moment I stepped on the ferry to the summit of the mountain took me 45 minutes, about 2 miles of road biking and 1.2 miles of hiking. On my way back to the ferry, I stopped and laid out in the grass on the side of the road for a bit, explored a beach, and grabbed a hot cocoa at the Guemes Island General Store right next to the ferry terminal.Just what I needed - a relaxing few hours out\u00a0in the island sun. :)", "date": "Mar 1, 2018"}, {"comment": "See additional links below for more trip photos.\u00a0With a high percentage of precipitation in the forecast, today\u2019s plan was not so much to chase the sun, as to find a place with the least amount of rain. After last week\u2019s visit to\u00a0Anderson Mountain, we sought out another new destination in the\u00a0Puget Sound\u00a0area, hoping to dodge the bad weather altogether.Guemes\u00a0Island was just a stone\u2019s throw away from the mainland and a five-minute ferry ride from Anacortes. We had seen the island from\u00a0Oyster Dome\u00a0on several occasions in the past. Since we\u2019d spend most of our time in the Cascades and\u00a0out east, I was suprised to find that this hideaway gem was actually open to the public.Once getting off the ferry on the other side, a two-mile drive east along the south shore quickly got us to the trailhead. Not much to see through the forest, but the sun had been out for a while so that\u2019s good news. A scenic overlook at 450\u2032 elevation provided views to the flat land below and\u00a0Cypress Island\u00a0in the background.Another 10 minutes of hiking and we were on the summit, where a\u00a0couple with two pups were leaving just as we arrived. We all agreed to have lucked out and got the beautiful weather despite the unpromising weather forecast. We enjoyed a long break on top while savoring views of other islands and the calm around us.On the way down, we opted for the south trail to make a loop out of the trip. Trail turned into road by the cool looking \"Rainbarn\" next to the radio facility, where we got a glimpse of cloud-capped mountains to the east. The road eventually connected with Holiday Blvd., where we hiked west and back down to South Shore Road. From the road, we then hiked .4 mile north and back to the trailhead with one other car parked behind us.Only 1 PM and we had plenty of time to spare, so I decided to drive around the peaceful island through the main roads.

This park is a treasure, but needs a decent map indication the proper trails for hiking and would benefit enormously from signage. Hope that's forthcoming! The trails were mostly good, although quite muddy.", "date": "Apr 10, 2018"}, {"comment": "We arrived at the parking lot mid afternoon on a beautiful Saturday afternoon. It was not very crowded even with the park, including a kid's playground, right there. It's really a network of trails used by walkers and mountain bikers, no signage. On this walk we only saw one pair of bikers and just a few hikers. We wore boats expecting some muddy trails and found a magical spot over the water with three wooden swings and\u00a0 a rope swing. In fall it's a great place to view salmon swimming upstream with Puyallup's historical fish hatchery right there. We've gone cross country skiing there in a good snow.

Maybe it was because I hiked the upper section in spring/summer-ish but I liked that part better. It's a decent trail overall, I have just as nice trails closer to me so I probably won't be back for awhile. The lower section did have a horse trail that was dirt and offered a bit more in the way of difficulty, but I stuck to the paved trail excepted to avoid a dog who's owner wasn't being considerate. I also drove past the Lake Youngs trail on my way to Lake Meridian park.

We began at the trailhead on 208th in Kent and walked about 3 miles before heading back. The trail is not fully shaded, so you will need some sun protection if it is hot and sunny outside; a sun hat, umbrella, sunscreen, etc. The trail is mostly flat and stroller or carrier friendly for those with little ones in tow. The bugs were a bit obnoxious on some parts of the trail; I imagine because it was late in the afternoon and a bit humid out as well. Great trail!!", "date": "Apr 28, 2016"}],

"comments":[{"comment": "I sometimes drive through parts of Interlaken Park, often after a visit to the nearby Asian Art Museum, but I had not hiked the trails here for many years. A brief mention of the park trails in Christina Hickman's article (Sep-Oct 2017 Washington Trails) reminded me of them. Today was bright and sunny and, with minimal free time, I was seeking a \"new\" urban walk, and I set out with Interlaken in mind.I parked near the trailhead at the corner of E Interlaken Blvd and 21st Ave E and headed west on the broad paved \"trail\" - actually it's a continuation of E Interlaken Blvd, now restricted to foot and bicycle traffic. In about 600 ft I headed left up a good trail that parallels a small stream, today not much more than a trickle. The footing was good here, and the trail has some nice stairs that add variety.I stayed on this trail, avoiding two side trails to the right, and soon reached the high point near E Galer St and 19th Ave E, where I turned around and headed back down the trail. In about 300 feet I stayed left at a trail fork and later, at another trail fork, headed left down some stone stairs. The ongoing trail followed along above E Interlaken Blvd and eventually dropped back down to the street.I continued, initially north, on this street. Beyond 19th Ave E it again is open to cars, but traffic seemed very light today. I stayed on E Interlaken Blvd for about another 750 ft and, where the street makes a sharp loop to the right, I paused to read the commemorative stone monument on the left. It honors Louisa Boren (1827-1916,) an early Seattle pioneer and longest surviving member of the Denny Party. ( https://borenstemk8.seattleschools.org/about/about_boren_stem/louisa_boren )I recalled that, a number of years ago, a trail began here that continued on uphill all the way to a viewpoint at Boren Park near the corner of 15th Ave E and E Garfield St. The trail still is visible, but today it was blocked by a chained gate and posted with a sign announcing trail closure and warning of unspecified dangers. (Mud? Blowdowns? Landslides? Perhaps bears?) I opted not to explore it today, and just turned around and followed E Interlaken Blvd back to my trailhead. After my hike I drove around to Boren Park to check out the viewpoint, and noted that the upper end of the closed trail is chained and gated too. The viewpoint is worth a visit on a clear day, when a long section of the Cascades is visible from around Stevens Pass north to Mt. Baker.It's really not wildflower season yet, although I did note Indian plum doing well here and there in the park, plus a few of the non-native snowdrops introduced by early European settlers. I also noted one lone skunk cabbage, no doubt the first of more to come. I heard a few bird calls, but most of the callers remained out of sight.Total distance was about 1.6 miles. Elevation varied from 125 feet to 325 feet.The trails were in good condition, and were surprisingly uncrowded today in spite of the bright sun and clear air. It was a good day to be out.", "date": "Mar 3, 2018"}],

"comments":[{"comment": "Great weather, beautiful trial. I was the only person on the entire trail Sunday night as far as I can tell.Because I don't think it's specifically listed, there are three points at which the tide matters before you get to Toleak. On Third Beach, the mudslide requires a ~5' tide to comfortably get around, but you can scramble over the rocks in basically anything short of a storm. To get between Taylor Point and Scott's Bluff, you will need a 4' tide to comfortably get around, but you can scramble over the rocks with a ~6' tide. To get past the beach immediately after Scott's Bluff, you will absolutely need a 4' tide, maybe even a 3' tide.I planned the hike poorly, but it still worked out just fine. I hit the trailhead at noon, and high tide was at 2pm. I was able to scramble past the mudslide on Third beach and made it to Taylor Pit at 1:00. I was not able to get to Scott's bluff, and had to wait until close to 4:00. After you pass Scott's Bluff, get onto the beach as soon as possible. A storm must have blown a bunch of wood and trash onto the trail because I don't know exactly where the trail is supposed to dump onto the beach, and it's easier to just walk\u00a0on the sand. Didn't see an overland marking either (big circular sign). On this beach there is a large boulder sticking way out into the sand. That's the squeeze point. I had to wait until 6:00 to pass. I got to Toleak at 6:45, and the rest of the way there is easily passable at any tide.I camped right on Toleak Point where the sand is highest, which was admittedly playing it a little close with the 9' high tide at 2am, but my tent was still ~50ft from the high tide line.The next morning, low tide was at 8:30am. I left at 9:30 and all of the previously mentioned points were very easy to pass. Got back to Third Beach around noon with a few short breaks.All ropes are intact and feel sturdy. The trail is muddy but easily passable. There are downed trees here and there, but nothing that ever posed a problem.Saw a bunch of eagles and a few deer. Lots of raccoon tracks in the sand, but didn't see any in the flesh. No signs of bears. Saw some spouts in the distance from Taylor Point, probably early grays.If I were to plan this again and I faced the problem of having high tide in the middle of the day, here's how I would\u00a0hike it. I would spend the night somewhere in the Olympic peninsula, probably at Second Beach, and hit the Third Beach trailhead 3 or 4 hours before the morning low tide. That would mean you're hitting the tightest squeeze right at low tide, and would make it to Toleak without a hitch around noon at the latest.\u00a0", "date": "Mar 18, 2018"}, {"comment": "Hiked south from Third Beach and spent the night at Toleak Point with the only neighbor about a quarter mile to the north. Saw an incredible sunset but missed out on the Milky Way due to clouds.The trail is muddy in places (but not significantly so), there are occasional\u00a0downed trees to navigate over/around, and the ropes for headland crossings are all intact.\u00a0", "date": "Mar 10, 2018"}, {"comment": "This hike truly changed my opinion of the Washington Coast. It is amazingly beautiful with all the sea-stacks. Having your bedroom be the view of the sun going down and the sounds of the ocean rolling up to you takes anything I've done before down a notch. The fact that you earned the views just made it that much better. Day 1: Started a bit late but did the car drop at oil city and drove to Third Beach. The hike to Third Beach was easy, but crowded there. We started our first beach walk heading down to the point. Sun our faces and amazing views all the way down. The first rope climb wasn't terrible, but it was no joke with 40 lbs on you back. A couple of rope ladders and a hike through the woods we were back on the beach. Hiked all the way to Strawberry Point. Along the way we saw a bald eagle, a sea otter and a dead whale carcass. In retrospect we should have gone a little bit farther, but we ended early. Talked with a Ranger named Squid who let us know there is an entire burn ban and gave us the heads up that Toleak was pretty full of campers. End day one and watch an amazing sunset. Day Two: Based on the guidance from the Rangers we made our final destination Jefferson Point. Filled up on water at Toleak and headed on our way. We walked a lot of the way along the beach this trek, took a swim in Mosquito Creek, and had a long hike through the woods. We saw a seal out in the water in a blink and you'll miss it moment. Still seeing the views from the ground and the bluffs was gorgeous. The final decent into Jefferson Point is no joke. Glad I was going down because it's a straight down drop. Ladder was in good condition, but one rung is broken which gave me pause for a minute. Wasn't heading back up though. Day Three: We got up early so we won't be trapped by the tides.. The tide itself came within ten feet of our tents at high tide so we were hugging the cliff wall. In the middle of the night we think a deer knocked some rocks loose, but gave us a big time wake up call. The exit around Jefferson Point is a scramble along large wet boulders that get blocked in by high tide. These are slick and covered in barnacles. Once you hit the sand though you're in the home stretch. Look for the cairn to mark your exit off the beach and up to the woods. Then before you know it you're out!Enjoy this hike. It's well worth all the ups and downs. Note that most of the ups is straight up. You'll be climbing ropes, ladders and hugging the walls. Don't let that discourage you though. It's all worth it.", "date": "Sep 2, 2017"}, {"comment": "We headed to Toleak Point for what I suspect will be my last backpacking trip of 2017. Despite the overflowing parking lot at the trail head, it was not as crowded as I anticipated for a beautiful Labor Day weekend and we were able to find a nice campsite without much trouble.The trail itself was not nearly as treacherous as I remember from past experience. It hasn't rained in quite some time so it was far less muddy and slippery than I remember. The rope ladders are a little bit of a challenge- we were glad to have gardening gloves to protect our hands.A word of caution: nighttime high tide made for a bit of a sleepless night at one point. If you are camped between Scotts Bluff and Toleak Point, be aware that the beach is relatively narrow. If you want to be 100% certain you'll stay high and dry all night, camp at Toleak Point or beyond.", "date": "Sep 2, 2017"}, {"comment": "What an adventure! My backpacking buddy and I set out for our two night, three day backpacking trip down the South Olympic coast on July 3, and the Third Beach trailhead parking lot was PACKED.

We camped for the night at Toleak Point, then day hiked further south on 7/4, making it almost to Mosquito Creek and back. 7/5, we hiked back out from Toleak Point. Wildlife sightings included many deer, a few bald eagles (what a way to celebrate the Fourth!), and one large decomposing whale.The trail is largely in excellent condition, with the exception of a couple easy-to-maneuver downed trees, and the ever-fun rope-assisted ascents at most of the transition points between beach and forest trail. Definitely keep an eye out for tides, as well!Overall, a beautiful, low-stress, and excellent adventure. ", "date": "Jul 3, 2017"}],

The trail crosses 9 parks so it is accessible at different points giving you the ability to pick a length suitable for all ages and skill levels.  Along the way you'll pass waterfalls, creeks, wetlands, old growth trees, and blueberry fields.  We've hiked most sections and have never been disappointed.  Today with an hour on our hands we entered at the West Lake Sammamish Trailhead and hiked to Weowna Park.  Along the way we saw ducks, three waterfalls, and the first Trillium of the season.

I parked in the lot near the intersection of SE 16th St and 156th Ave SE, found the trail at the east end of the lot and headed north toward Larsen Lake. Signs along the way warn of \"dive bombing\" by aggressive barred owls, but today the owls remained out of sight and ignored me.\r The route is varied; some of it passing over rather swampy terrain and much of it passing blueberry fields that still are farmed today. A short, rather dark section passes through a grove of cedars, the only part of the route that feels like an actual forest. The trails are wide, and either graveled or barked for good footing.\r I had downloaded a trail map from parkstrails.myparksandrecreation.com/Details.aspx?pid=467, and I followed the route that loops around Larsen Lake. Along the north shore, a viewing platform offers good views across the lake. Nearby, I noted the inevitable, well-intentioned person encouraging a small kid to offer bits of white bread to a dozen mallard ducks. The ducks clearly relished the offerings, gleefully unaware of possible nutritional implications.\r Near the SE corner of the lake, a well-built (relocated) pioneer home stands, and sign boards offer interesting commentary on the early days (1880s) when this part of Bellevue was mostly wilderness.\r I completed the loop around the lake, and returned to the parking lot the way I had come. But there was a bit more to do since Lake Hills Greenbelt extends another half mile to the SE. I crossed the busy streets and took the asphalt trail heading south, parallel to 156th Ave SE. In about a quarter mile I took the side trail heading slightly downhill toward Phantom Lake. Along the way another sign board comments on how nature, and early pioneers, made major changes to the lake levels and stream flows.\r Near the shore of Phantom Lake the trail forks. The right fork leads to a picnic table, while the left fork leads to a viewing platform that offers a great view across the lake. After a long look, I returned to the parking lot the way I had come.", "date": "Nov 10, 2015"}],

What a gorgeous hike. I can see bringing kids and \"non-hikers\" to at least the first bridge (~1mile round trip) to show off how beautiful our mountains are.US2 was clear all the way to Foss Lake Road. Both Foss Lake Road and FR 68 were damp but clear. There are some minor potholes and washboards on FR68, but I had no issues in my FrontWD compact.I intended to head up to the valley and get to the Foss River bridge, or solar noon - whichever happened first - and then have lunch and go back. I arrived at the TH at 0830, no other cars. I took a leisurely pace, stopping for lots of pictures. The promised rain never happened, but there were scattered sun showers. I didn't see snow until about 2000', and then only off-trail in open (in the sense of devil's club and viny maple) meadows. There wasn't any snow on the trail until about half a mile from the Foss River bridge, and that was shallow and melting fast. I was about a mile from the bridge at solar noon, so I pushed on for it. My pace was especially pokey because I'm sick and I had to take lots of photos of the waterfalls. I encountered one other person and his two dogs, he said we were the only cars in the lot.The Foss River bridge took a direct hit from a blowdown. It's still there, but it appears that that the river pushed a blowdown over it, wrecking about half the handrail and putting a sizable obstacle across the tread. This is why I mentioned \"Obstacles on Trail\", but be advised the trail up to the bridge is in good shape.I double backed to the camping area, fixed lunch, and made it back to the car in about 2.25 hours. Overall I spent about 7 hours on the trail; GPS shows 10.4 miles and 1000` of elevation for a very leisurely, warm, sunny hike. The rain came at about 16:00, and it was dumping really well for a while, slowing all the ski traffic on US2 even more. I had assumed that if I got back onto the road before dark, I'd miss enough of the traffic from Steven's Pass - I was wrong. I'll probably stay off US2 on the weekends until the ski area closes.", "date": "Nov 19, 2017"}, {"comment": "Yay!\u00a0 The funky bridge across Burn Creek has been rebuilt!\u00a0 Thank you, whoever did this work.\u00a0 The East Fork Foss trail is an easy, pleasant walk in the woods from the trailhead all the way to the Foss Creek crossing.\u00a0 It is 5 miles one way with a gain of only 600 ft.\u00a0 The first section up to the bridge has a few rocky parts but otherwise a gentle ascent.\u00a0 A ways after the bridge is a small blowdown, easy to step over.\u00a0 Alturas \"Lake\" is about the midpoint of the hike.\u00a0 It is really a marsh rather than a lake but it does open up the forest a bit for some views.Past Alturas is a series of old puncheons, overgrown, mossy, and crowded on both sides by vegetation.\u00a0 It would take a crew several days to clean and refurbish them.\u00a0 There are two washouts further on which consist mainly of stony debris over the trail.\u00a0 Easy to cross and we built cairns at the larger one. \u00a0 We turned around at the small ravine which is bridged by a slippery wet log.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0", "date": "Oct 27, 2017"}, {"comment": "Did a long solo day hike to the meadow just past Opal Lake on a beautiful cool fall day.

I lead our school's hiking club on a trip here, and although I researched the trail, I couldn't figure out what exactly was going on with where it started. The fact that there are two trail heads complicates things, but that wasn't the main issue. Doing the longer, 7.8 mile trail, the start is near buck creek campground. Go across the bridge on the way to buck creek and immediately turn left into a small parking lot. However, the trail that is clearly marked as \"Skookum Flats,\" with a billboard and sign at the end of the parking lot is NOT the correct trail. This is just a short path leading to buck creek campground. The trail to the falls is across the road from the parking lot, and the sign marking it as the Skookum Flats trail can't be seen until you're standing on the opposite side of the road from the parking lot, looking down into the trees. Next, the sign is directly in the middle of a fork in the trail. Both routes eventually meet up with the path, but left is the faster and better-maintained way. Soon after this, you'll reach a sign saying Buck Creek Trail is continuing the way you're heading. This is the Skookum Flats trail. Continue this way for a little over 2 miles before reaching another fork in the road. There is nothing to mark the fork except a blank post. Turn right. Continue until the sign for falls, and then go up a scramble trail to the left. Besides the confusion about the trail, this was a great hike to take a group of inexperienced hikers on! Everyone appreciated the trail being flat, and there are great views of the mountains and river almost the entire way to the falls.

It's been 10 years since \u00a0last there so Shadow Dog and I headed up.I stopped at the Verlot Ranger Station (really nice, helpful folks) to see if there were any conditions or goings-on I needed to know. They told me the major washout that had been a problem was recently repaired but warned of rough roads and potholes. They were right...the 6 or so miles of it from the ML Highway was pretty rough. Be aware of lots of potholes and rough, rocky sections. No problem for my old SUV with high clearance but a sedan with low clearance should\u00a0be careful and ease through the potholes\u00a0cautiously.The trail is pretty short, just under 2 mi. according to the WTA description. But remember, even an elevation gain of only 1200 feet over that distance means some decent incline and a bit of a workout. That, combined with lots of roots and a moderate amount of rocks and boulders, means a little minor climbing and a workout for the knees. Lots of gnarly root nests and moderate boulders result in some pretty good step-ups (and climb downs on return trip). You may want to consider this if you are thinking of taking small children but, older children should have no real problem.Still, this is a nice trail in beautiful, quiet woods with ferns, huge old timber and solitude. Take the short side trip out to Bear Lake, take a peek and then head on to Pinnacle Lake. Just before you get there, you will see a pretty little tarn on your right.

I put on my trusty snowshoes, and starting the climb, following the obvious trail through a few patches of slide alder. Frankly, the terrain is fairly open and sufficiently snow-covered that you can traverse it in snowshoes without paying too much attention to route-finding: just head up. I should note that the south-facing side of the ridge is snow-free at places, which might help snowshoe-less hikers bypass some (but not all) of the postholing drudgery. The summit is, amusingly enough, more wooded than most of the approach trail, and thus the views were underwhelming.Way back: Given how flat the trail is, the hike back wasn't measurably faster than the hike in, and the snow had warmed enough that I decided to keep my snowshoes\u00a0for a good part of the return trip.

From the west end, you can descend briefly and then go two miles to a one mile loop with views of Diamond head. From the east end, you can go straight two miles paralleling the highway to the Blewett Pass Snopark. There are two other choices from this same east end start. In about 10 minutes, you can go right at an intersection and follow that to Swauk Meadow. This is the most popular route. If you start on this route, in 20-30 minutes you can choose another right onto a deadend road that goes for a mile or so. Because I had never done this one before, we chose it today. It offers a few glimpses of Stuart and a good view of Diamond Head. We had to break trail today on this last mile. We sunk in to mid-calf and it was hard work. The snow has been melting during the afternoon the past few days, so there is crust with a deep soft layer underneath. It was sunny and warm enough to do the trip in a t-shirt today. With a map and a little navigation experience, there are many loops and connections you can make between all the different roads and trails.

Today, I went east (left as you enter the snopark) and then in about 15 minutes took a right. At the next intersection, in about a half hour more, I went left. This led to Swauk Meadow, acres of open field great for skiing. I skied up to the top of the meadow where it meets the main snowmobile road coming from Blewett Pass. Snow conditions were perfect today, with about a foot of powder in the meadow. There is a good track all the way there from previous skiers and snowshoers. I prefer skiing to snowshoeing in this area due to the gentle grades and the advantage of descending on skis rather than walking down. It took a little over an hour to get all the way to the turnaround and a half hour to get back. There was no one else on the trail today.

The other way, right, actually goes to Pipe Ck. Today's trip was on a gently ascending road the whole way. It is easy, and has no views but the immediately surrounding woods and a few open glades. You parallel the highway all the way and can hear traffic. I think the Pipe Ck alternative is the preferable choice. It is longer, quieter, and has more views.

We started at the Pipe Creek Sno-Park.  When we came to the fork at the bottom of the loop we went to the right and snowshoed up to Swauk Meadows.  It was just under 2 miles, but yours truly started running out of gas, so we found a nice Ponderosa Pine to sit under for lunch.  Most of the rest of the loop is either near a snow mobile trail or the highway, so we decided to go back down the way we came.  When we came to the junction with XC Trail #141.2 we decided to walk up it for a ways.  After 10 minutes or so of climbing I began pooping out again, so we turned around and headed back to the truck.  The snow wasn't deep, so the snowshoeing was pretty easy.  Above the junction with Trail #141.2 there were a number of blow-downs across the trail, but they were all easily stepped over.  It snowed all day and we didn't see any other skiers or snowshoers.

At that switchback snow starts to accumulate on the road rather quickly. About 1/2 way up that switchback to where the to the Lake Eleanor TH is located the snow becomes very deep and all the sudden, there were cars parked everywhere because the road was impassible to most. Even the big 4x4 trucks were having trouble. We parked here and walked the last 1.25ish miles to the unsigned TH at the next switchback. We have a RAV4, after the hike we used a snow shovel and with 3 men to push us we were able to turn around to get back into the tracks. It wouldn't be a good place to slide off the road and it was hard to get traction. There is a layer of hard older snow that was rained on with fresh slippery snow on top. That being said, a party of 3 in jeeps did drive past us close to the TH. It depends on your vehicle, skills, equipment.\u00a0Trail: this was our first time here. There were no tracks leading to the lake and it isn't easy to find the trail. It isn't a difficult snowshoe, never steep or difficult terrain. There was enough snow that snowshoes are easier than not. Other than finding the sign for the trail explaining where to get camping permits, etc a short distance from the road and ending up on the trail\u00a0near Lake Eleanor, we were on our own for navigation, which is relatively simple. We followed a GPS via the route of least resistance towards the lake through a mix of snow depths and over/around various downed trees and ended up finding trail (evidenced by the cairns of winter-- cut trees along the trail) not far from the lake. It was somewhat slow going for us because the snow isn't deep enough to cover all the \"stuff\" in most areas plus we did a lot of postholing in the untracked snow where the snow was deep. Lake was pretty with some rocky cliffs of Scarface peak across it.\u00a0We had hoped to get into Grand Park but we lost a fair amount of time on the road debacle, by the time we reached Eleanor it was almost our turn around time.\u00a0This likely won't be accessible for long unless you can manage the road in deep snow or don't mind the road walk.\u00a0", "date": "Nov 24, 2017"}, {"comment": "Despite the closure notice on WTA, this trail is open and in great shape.

I did not read trail description before heading out, so I had to choose, my instinct saying the one on the right is for the lake, so I chose the one on the left, ha.

A couple things if you extend your trip to horseshoe lake below.\u00a0a couple notes...after awhile you will cross a stream, go straight (not to the right). Also, when you reach the meadow, you should stay to the right of it...its a fragile, huge, awesome meadow, its kind of wack to trump around in it when there is a trail to follow (hugging it to the right). \u00a0if you feel like you're off the trail, step on a rock/downed tree, you will see the trail somewhere. \u00a0Lots of downed trees, annoying - but manageable. \u00a0At the end of the meadow you start your ascent (to the right). \u00a0this last bit takes a good hour, be prepared. \u00a0we encountered a family of goats just as we were reaching the lake, a goat\u00a0was looking down from above us on a perch. \u00a0then we saw a couple baby goats about 15 feet away. \u00a0then came big male goats w/ horns, who walked us back down slowly.

"comments":[{"comment": "With an unbelieveable forecast of 40 degrees and clear skies at the top of dragontail in the last week of October...we decided to make a quick trip to cap the year.\u00a0We started early at 4:15 from the Stuart Lake Trailhead. There were maybe 4 cars in the lot. Trail right upto the lake is in good condition. The wind storm from last weekend seems to have downed a number of trees but all of these are very easy to pass/climb over. We made it to the lake around 6:15 and\u00a0 were a little worried about crossing the boulders and the rock being wet with dew - but none of these turned out to the case and soon enough we were at the little sandy beach at the bottom of the Aasgard pass.\u00a0Water levels are really low at this time. The \"beach\" stretched almost to the start of the boulder field and you can see the original water marks on the exposed rocks.\u00a0Back to the climb - The first part until the \"tree island\" was pretty standard stuff..rocks, rocks, rocks....something that passes as a trail. Then from this point onwards we started to see hard packed snow/ice on the trail. Going up was not difficult and you can find your way around the rocks without getting on the ice. There is a pretty decent boot path\u00a0as well. The snow bridges are starting to build up. Once we got to the 2nd snow bridge crossing\u00a0 I opted to put my crampons on my shoes while my hiking buddy was comfortable without them. There pretty significant boot prints on\u00a0all the snow bridges\u00a0and the snow is packed pretty hard so\u00a0take a call on what you are comfortable with in terms of gear while crossing them.\u00a0Once past the bridges - we veered right and took the trail to dragontail and finally made crested the pass as the morning sun started to beat down on the core.\u00a0We started to make our way up towards the peak and were looking for a boot path but was surprised to find none. 30 minutes and 200 feet later we realized why that was the case. The snow from last week has not yet compacted and was very soft. As a result we were post-holing every 3rd step and it was just annoying. Finally we decided to call it and just head back down and come back next year.\u00a0The core looked beautiful with a fresh coat of snow but we are pretty sure it will be the same there as well so decided to eat some breakfast at our high point and turned back.\u00a0The way down was tough especially with the ice. The pass barely gets any sunlight with the angle of the sun so those icy spots are going to stay until next year. We passed a couple of groups that\u00a0 were woefully prepared and just wanted to get to the pass at any cost. With changing conditions please be prepared. One group didnt have spikes or poles...As always that last mile from the bridge seemed like forever but we were glad that we got to spend the day up in the area. We did see an\u00a0avalanche on the way out - it was right in the center of dragontail and cascaded down (but away from the trails).\u00a0", "date": "Oct 29, 2017"}, {"comment": "We set off from\u00a0the Stuart lake trailhead\u00a0at ~8:30 this morning with the intention of doing Colchuk lake and seeing how far up Aasgard we could go.\u00a0 We made great time getting to Colchuck and walked around the lake, then began up Aasgard.\u00a0 The trail appeared to be snow free and not too bad, so we stashed our packs and decided to make an attempt to get to the top.\u00a0 However, we hit a cairn ~1/2 way up...then lost our way.\u00a0 There seemed to be 2 major rock slides, and we headed left to avoid them and hopefully stay on the trail.\u00a0 Things looked grim and we didnt have a clear idea of where to go, so we turned around. Perhaps the recent rockslide washed out the cairns and part of the path?\u00a0 Either way, lots of loose rock.", "date": "Oct 26, 2017"}, {"comment": "Set out from Stuart Lakes TH in the morning with the goal to get up Aasgard into the Enchantments and then double back\u00a0past Colchuck.\u00a0 Snow at the TH, just got heavier as we made our way up.\u00a0 Definitely a little sketchy getting across the boulder field at the far end of Colchuck, but not too bad with spikes.\u00a0 As we started to make our way up Aasgard there was a major slide above us (Snow/Rock).\u00a0 We scrambled a bit to get out of the path, but the slide didn't make it all the way down to us.\u00a0 Fairly intense, though.\u00a0 Be careful up there - lot of snow and wind.\u00a0 Beautiful spot in the snow, with the larches still holding their needles though.\u00a0\u00a0", "date": "Oct 21, 2017"}, {"comment": "Short version: Extremely snowy and dangerous, do not attempt without proper gear and training! I was lucky to make it out with my group after an overnight trip on 10/20!Long version: Went with a group of 8 to try a 3-day outing starting at the\u00a0Lake Stuart TH and ending at the Snow Lake TH. Weather was looking good Friday morning around 6:30 AM so we set out and got to Aasgard pass before noon (taking lots of pictures and enjoying the scenery along the way). We didn't hit much snow, just some spots with a bit of frost mostly. The pass looked OK from the base, snow at the top but didn't look too bad. Boy were we wrong! We got up almost all the way and the snow was about a foot deep at this point, and no one in the group felt comfortable going back down (no ice axes), so we kept going. The pass was extremely difficult with the snow cover and looked ripe for an avalanche in spots. We got up and over and set up camp next to Isolation Lake.It snowed heavy most of the night and we woke up to 2-3 foot snow with 4-5 foot dunes. Set out from camp around 7:30 AM with intentions to camp at Upper Snow Lake but hit trouble the whole way down, as well as constant snow all day. Most of the trail markers were covered so we moved slowly trying to keep on trail and avoid dangerous water crossings that were covered in ice and hidden with snow. One of our group fell into 2 ft deep water around 8:30 AM, but was OK. Post-holing with every step kept us moving very slow. We had to backtrack a few times to ensure we weren't crossing water. We descended down from Lake Viviane on and off-trail. All trail markers were completely covered at this point so we tried our best and found several but got a bit lost at points. Ended up doing some sketchy butt-slides ranging from 10-20 ft into the soft snow, and made it down to the trail by ~5:30 PM. This was one of the scariest spots for our group, and I somehow overcame my fear of heights and led everyone down the \"safest\" route. Ice ax HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.At this point it started\u00a0raining very heavily and most in our group had wet gear (despite having waterproof shells and pack covers) so we decided to skip camping another night and just get off of the trail. It got dark around 6:30 PM while we were skirting around Upper Snow Lake. We did get a bit lost near the dam crossing but found the trail pretty quickly. We were trudging through 3-6 inch deep water at this point with the rain and melting snow creating a lovely slush. Everyone's waterproof boots gave up at this point so each step was icy cold. Hiked non-stop for what seemed like forever and got off the trail at 12:30 AM. Everyone in our group had mild hypothermia and frostbite, and a few non-serious injuries including slammed knees and pretty bad sores from packs rubbing skin.\u00a0We were all seriously lucky to make it out alive. The group has varying ranges of experience in situations like this and luckily everyone kept a level head and made (mostly) correct decisions. Unfortunately by the time we knew what the top had in store, we were too far to turn back. Learn from our mistake and only attempt the trip if you are very well prepared and experienced with deep snow travel and navigation! It was extremely beautiful but NOT WORTH THE RISK in our opinion.", "date": "Oct 20, 2017"}, {"comment": "What a day! I've been dying to do the Enchantments forever, so five friends and I completed a late-season larch-filled thru hike in a day this weekend.We hit Leavenworth on Saturday night around 11pm and set up\u00a0our tents\u00a0in a pullout on Icicle Rd. We set our shuttle car at Snow Lakes just before 7am (at which point the parking lot was already full) and were at the Stuart trailhead by 7:15am.The amount of snow on the trail was surprisingly low for this time of year. We reached Colchuck Lake by 9am, and the trail was largely snow-free up until the boulder field just before Aasgard - which is, coincidentally, where we started seeing hoards of people.The boulder field was a little treacherous. We navigated it using all fours and didn't take any falls, but the icy rocks are a sprained ankle waiting to happen.Aasgard is where the snow begins - although still fairly little. I didn't put my (half-broken) Yaktrax on until halfway up, and one member of our party didn't have any traction devices whatsoever, but he managed totally fine. We started our ascent around 10:15am and were on top of the pass before noon. Nothing too difficult, and plenty of people/boottracks to follow. The snow was never more than a couple inches deep.Post-Aasgard, our pace slowed significantly, stopping to savor every moment of the gorgeous alpine lakes all around us. The trail was much more crowded than I anticipated, and it really felt more like we were on an adult playground than a wilderness hiking trail. The snow\u00a0on the trail here was never more than an inch or so, and primarily just patches of small ice/dirty snow where it did exist. No traction needed.After reaching Snow Lakes, the descent was a bit of a slog - slow and tedious, constantly feeling like we weren't getting anywhere.\u00a0We finally arrived at the Snow Lakes trailhead just as it got dark, 7:00pm straight up to make for a just under 12-hour day.Routefinding was never really an issue given the popular nature of this trail, but we did consult our topo maps a few times just to be sure we were on the correct path. When the next big snowfall hits, you'll want to be sure you have maps to keep you on track.The larches, though past their peak and quickly dropping needles, are still stunning - and this region truly lives up to its name, nothing short of enchanting.", "date": "Oct 15, 2017"}],

As mentioned the trail/road has several trees down, most of which are fairly easily passed now, and a considerable amount of trash and shell casings. Once you get past the initial washout it's a pretty smooth walk through the forest with a couple of trees that require a little duck under or step over. \r Once at the mill foundation you can decide how much exploring you want to do. I was with a couple of people that didn't have a whole lot of patience/experience with the bushwacking exploration style.I did some bushwacking of my own on a spur from the trail that follows Trout Creek. and headed up the hill to see what I could find. I ended up turning around about 100 feet below what is known as the West Stope. I know this now because if you google \"sunset mine map\" you get a Forest Service and USDA report on pollution in the area from the mine. In this 154 page report are detailed maps of the locations of the adits and stopes in the area. Since the amount of exploring needed to locate the mine itself was beyond what my fellow hikers were interested in we settled for following a stream to the lower adit that is easy to find due to the water flowing from it just up the trail from the mill foundation and we broke for lunch on the creek bank then headed back. \r Overall a decent little trip without seeing anyone else. Might be good to pair with another short one like Heybrook Lookout which is just East on highway 2 from index. \r  BE CAREFUL: I came across several sinkholes in my bushwacking that you could easily drop a leg into if not cautious.

I'd planned to return here for a daytrip but decided I'd go in from the Trout Lake side for variety. The Jack Creek and Trout Lake trails aren't much to write about. Standard forest trail, kind of horsey, no views. Nice and cool compared to the heat of Eightmile though, and no crowds. The trail up towards Windy from Jack was a bit rough with a few large trees down.\rWhen I reached a stream above treeline I went straight upslope through some nice meadows. Before long I reached a nice pleateau around 6900 ft with a very nice tarn; home for the night. I claimed the one slightly established campsite, grabbed a light pack, and continued up to the ridge. Another few hundred feet and I intersected the ridgeline path heading towards Cashmere. What a great ridge walk! This time I got to travel more of it. When Lindsey and I went several years ago in May we took a much more direct ascent from Caroline Lakes.\rAfter awhile I was at the base of the summit block. I traded my ballcap for climbing helmet and started the traverse. I knew enough to stay low and not get tempted up to the ridge crest too early. The snow traverse that stopped us two years ago was all of 20 ft long and easily crossed. Even though I knew to stay low I found myself being suckered upwards and was faced with some real scrambling. I did one move that was probably 4th class, realized I must be going wrong, and retreated. I kept going across and eventually found an easy dirty gully that took me up to within 20 ft of the top, then a simple step onto the summit!\rMy route mistakes ate up a lot of time so it was an abbreviated stay. Views were grand in all directions. I descended closer to the east ridge, following the dirty gully, before traversing back west. One or two spots I used my hands to step down but overall just class 2 stuff with dirt and loose small rocks. I dropped down below a large snowfield and climbed back up to the main route. One could probably stay more level above this. Basically I'd say, to find the class-2 route to the top, start traversing and just keep going until you think you should be going up, then go a little further. The easiest route I found was almost all the way across.\rI still had enough sunlight for a good swim and the bugs had died down a bit. The tarn is shallow and appeared to be very muddy. I stepped in, expecting to sink to my knees in goop, and instead found it's hard dirt with an inch or two of grease! I slipped right down into the lake. That's one way to get over the cold-shock I guess.\rDead calm overnight with a new moon and great stars. I reluctantly put the fly on the tent when I noticed a lot of dew building up inside. I did set a midnight watch alarm for some star photos.\rMorning brought clear skies and chilly temperatures. I packed up, finding someones discarded trash pile in the process, and headed out. Rather than descend the valley I climbed back up on the ridge to finish off the walk down to Windy Pass before heading down the full trail. Some nice larch and meadows below Windy Pass but once below treeline it's not the most interesting trail. If possible I'd recommend a car shuttle for a one-way trip.", "date": "Aug 6, 2016"}, {"comment": "We hiked up to the bridge and just a little further, but we decided to turn around as the trail was getting smaller and downed trees were getting bigger.

It's more than a washout- the road is TOTALLY GONE after that point (we walked a little ways down the road to see). It makes sense why it's not being repaired. \r We wanted a short easy walk since my partner is recovering from a nasty ankle sprain so we hiked to the site of the Sunrise Mine. Despite what you might find online, there is no way a vehicle could drive down the road the hike is on, it has a big blockage with some large boulders and a washout just after the first switchback. All we found was a concrete foundation and another 1/2 mile or so down the road to a very old bridge across Trout Creek and a pretty campsite. The road has countless blowdowns across it. Seriously, a lot of them. It's the sort of thing where a party with some chainsaws could have a real good time for a full day. I had ample opportunities to practice my tree-crossing yoga one-foot balancing. Close to and beyond the concrete foundation the streams have taken over the road. Beyond the bridge the road isn't much of a road, we decided it was far too overgrown/blowdown to bother with heading farther. It is a really beautiful spot by the creek. We enjoyed the walk overall and the lush, lovely forest all around. We were unable to find any mines but suspect it would require bushwhacking at this point. There were a few flags on trees that may have lead to them? \r There was an unfortunate amount of garbage at a campsite near the foundation, it looked fresh too since the paper wrappers o the cans were still fresh looking.

THIS INCLUDES A 10 MILE STRETCH OF THE PCT.\u00a0FOR THE MOST UP TO DATE INFORMATION VISIT THE FOREST SERVICE INCIDENT PAGE HERE.A group of friends and I started what was intended to be a three night backpacking trip in the Indian Heaven Wilderness area on Friday, September 1. We started our trip from where the PCT intersects NF-24 and hiked to Bear and Elk Lakes on our first day. We passed many PCT through hikers on the way there. We found a great group spot on Friday night at Bear Lake and spent the night there. Bear Lake was pretty, quiet, and perfect for floating and swimming.The next day, Saturday, September 2, we continued to Blue Lake, passing Junction Lake, and found all of the campsites at Blue Lake already taken. Not surprising given the holiday weekend. We found a flat spot in a grassy area about \u00bd mile up from Blue Lake along the Thomas Lake trail at what we think was Umtux Lake. The spot had plenty of room for three tents, plus some, and was surrounded by wild blueberry bushes. Concerned that we wouldn\u2019t find a better spot, we staked out our tents and left our overnight gear there. We took a quick day hike down to Thomas and Eunice Lakes. On our way there we saw dozens of groups hiking in from the Thomas Lake trailhead, so we were glad we found a campsite when we did. We enjoyed lunch at Thomas Lake and then made the climb back up to our campsite.In the afternoon, we decided to walk back down to Blue Lake to cool off. The temperature was in the 90s, so we all took a dip and floated on the rafts we packed in. The lake was bustling with other people swimming, fishing and floating.On Sunday morning we woke up around 8:30 AM and intended to have another leisurely day hiking to Lake Wapiki. While cooking breakfast we noticed nearby smoke. Initially we thought it was a large campfire, but the smoke turned black and the plume continued to grow in size. We were concerned and packed up immediately. At this point we decided it was best to cut the trip short and leave the area as soon as possible. The fire was to the north and slightly east, which was the way we had to hike out to get back to our cars. We started hiking that way until we were almost past Blue Lake and spoke to another hiker who had taken a bearing on the location of the fire and assessed that it was at Junction Lake and possibly very close to the trail.Concerned that we would be walking directly into the direction of the fire, we did an about-face and hiked away from the fire toward the Thomas Lake trailhead, which we knew would be safe. We had the incredible good fortune of running into friends on the trail who shuttled two from our group back to our cars that were parked at Cultus Creek Campground and the PCT/NF-24 intersection. The whole shuttle process took about two hours, which was much shorter than we anticipated. In that time, three of us sat and waited at the trailhead for the drivers to return. We saw a Forest Service Hotshot Crew arrive who closed the trail and geared up to evacuate the area. They hiked in with helmets, axes, chainsaws \u2013 pretty incredible to watch.By the time we were leaving the area, the plume from the fire was enormous. I had never seen a wildfire up close like that; it was jarring. The Hotshot Crew told us it had grown to cover about 500 acres. We learned from other hikers exiting the trail that it had indeed come extremely close to the PCT. Some people told us that they were walking as little as 50 feet away from visible flames. We were all so thankful to have made the decision to steer clear of the fires despite knowing that we were heading in the opposite direction of our cars. We also couldn\u2019t be more thankful to the Forest Service workers who responded in a matter of hours after the fire started.The entire Indian Heaven Wilderness area is now closed and likely will be for some time.

I ran into a couple that turned around here as they couldn't find the trail, which is definitely a smart move if you aren't familiar with the area. As evidenced in the previous trip report, this is not an area you want to take unnecessary risks in as it can be easy to get lost even in good conditions if you're not prepared.The pup and I post-holed it out Thomas Lake and the immediate smaller surrounding ones, which was easy enough, but the snow looked to get deeper on the trail out to Blue Lake so we called it quits here. I wanted more mileage, so we backtracked it Mcclellan Meadows trail to get in a few more miles in much warmer conditions.Another week or two of sun, and I suspect this area will be completely snow free.\u00a0", "date": "Jun 18, 2017"}, {"comment": "WOOF.  Getting to the trailhead took longer than GPS initially estimated, so I parked around 5:30 pm on Sunday.  Saw lots of folks coming out, two of whom seemed suspicious of my ability to night hike.\r Spoiler alert: THEY WERE RIGHT.\r I found this loop nearly impossible to navigate.  A gentleman coming out said he and others had recently put in a trail connecting Thomas Lake to Junction Lake; he suggested I start that way, then swing over to Blue Lake.  I like advice from outdoorsy people, so I made a mental note to veer left at the junction for blue lake.\r oh ho ho.  Who knows what trail I actually took--the signage is pretty bad, and the trails are a-plenty.  They fork all over the place.  At times, the trail is just depressed grass...enough to be able to see it and to know you'll be in trouble on the hike back in the dark.  I turned around at some other lake, where a friendly backpacker told me I was not at Junction Lake, but some other lake I now can't recall.   \r Note: none of the lakes are marked/signed/labeled.  So you come upon a lake and it seems reasonable enough that it should be the lake you're looking for.  \r I should have had roughly one hour of nighttime hiking from my turnaround point to the trailhead.  That was around 7 pm.  At 8:30 pm, I found a confusing sign and my second group of campers.

Whoops.\r I tried to turn around and just go back the way I had come, but somehow the forking put me on another path.  I started to suspect the Blair Witch was around at this point.\r Around 11 pm, I decided to screw the winding forking trails, and just get out my compass and navigate back to Thomas Lake thru the bush.  Lots of scrambling and muddy sliding and log-hopping and everything else you'd expect from a fun night off trail.  Around 12:30 am or so, I arrived at the lake; now I needed a trail back to the car.  I hunkered down in some weeds with my dog until morning, and once the sun was up, carefully walked around the lake, knowing there were campsites and therefore definitely a connection to my Magical Trail Home.  I found the trail after about 30 minutes of bush-whacking, and high-tailed it out of there singing \"a threeeee hour tour\".\r I would not try this hike again for $78.  I might try it in the daylight for $572, but I'd need to know my tax responsibility.\r Oh, BTW: the friendly backpacker at Wrong Lake #1 said she had almost gotten lost several times, as had folks she ran into earlier in the day.", "date": "Sep 25, 2016"}],

It was a good choice. There weren\u2019t any mountain views to miss, and the smoky haze wasn\u2019t as bad as some areas I drove through to get there.Bugs were bad at the trailhead, but just a minor nuisance when stopped along the trail.The trailhead signboard says the bridge is out. (It\u2019s a large footlog with no railing.) I found the bypass route, through the picnic area, over a bridge and past some summer cabins. It connects with the trail within sight of where you can ford the creek. (More on this later.)From the trail, I took both of the viewpoint side trails down to see Union Creek Falls, then continued on. There are a couple of large blowdowns presenting problems, one at 0.6 mile and another at 1.8 miles. There was also a gully washout at 1.2 miles that was crossable, but might not be after the next heavy rain.At 2 miles is a sturdy bridge over North Fork Union Creek, crossing above the waterfall that was visible moments earlier. I had an old Karen Sykes trail description with me, recommending to cross the bridge then \u201cturn the corner\u201d to find another waterfall. Fortunately, I didn\u2019t have to refer to that. As I crossed the bridge, I encountered two ladies from Yakima whom I had met at the trailhead. They pointed me along a path on the opposite side, saying that just around the corner was their favorite part of this hike, a place to put your feet in the water and just enjoy the scenery. I agree; it was the best part of the hike. Here\u2019s a shout-out to my Yakima friends!After capturing more photos, I continued on, undecided how far I would go. But I wanted to see the camp sites that were allegedly at 4 miles. Huckleberry bushes were plentiful along this part of the trail. In fact, they grew so close that my legs got scratched up. Still, I\u2019d rather have huckleberries along a trail than almost anything else. A very few of the berries were ripe, but by the end of August ripe berries will be plentiful.At 3.6 miles, the trail crested at nearly 4500 feet, then dropped toward Union Creek. This part of the trail has a LOT of blowdowns, and many of them are too big to step over. Still, the trail is easy to follow. At 4 miles, I saw one obvious camp beside Union Creek. But there was no obvious trail to it. I decided to keep going; maybe there were more ahead. A 5 miles, the brushy trail finally opened up. I could see this was the beginning of the 1250 foot climb up to the Basin Trail. I decided to turn around.\u00a0Back at the 4 mile point, I scouted up and down for a trail to the obvious camp. It was a nice flat spot beside the creek with a fire ring and a stump positioned on end, clearly a camp. But there was so much vegetation and so many trees down, that you couldn\u2019t easily see where to put your feet. Not only that, the creek was broad at that point, and the ground looked marshy under the vegetation. I decided not to explore any further. I will say this - along this section, where the creek was within sight of the trail, Union Creek has numerous small cascades and inviting pools. That water is sooooo clear and lovely!Post-Hike Information:Regarding the bypass route past the cabins - I was leery of crossing through private property. I made a call to the Naches Ranger Station a few days later and asked a few questions. I learned that they intend to replace or repair the footlog, but \u201cprobably not this year\u201d. They are aware that the trail needs maintenance. The ranger thanked me for my report on all the blowdowns, but again, it is a matter of funding and priority. (From reading other trip reports, I think this trail regularly get neglected. The bridge has been out for several years already, and it could be a while before the bridge is repaired and the trees and brush cleared.) Lastly, I asked what hikers are to do while the bridge/footlog is closed. Aren\u2019t the cabins on private property? The answer was \u201cNo. They are on public land. The Forest Service leases the land.\u201d She told me that hikers are permitted to walk between the cabins to get to the trail without fording the creek.", "date": "Aug 6, 2017"}, {"comment": "The Yakima Cascadians hiked the Union Creek trail heading for Crown Point.

It broke off into three trails and the one off to the left takes you down to the waterfall. Part of the tail was underwater because of how much rain we've had. The trail was slippery in areas where there were sharp rocks. It was hard to not get your feet wet after getting down into the canion due to the level of the Creek.

It was, after all, a Wednesday afternoon.  But it was a great spring day, with delightful cool mists coming off the river and falls.  The trail above the falls was fairly easy to follow: find a tree with a gray/blue diamond, go to it, and then find the next one on the path.The old grade road was exposed and warm, almost a welcome sensation this time of the year, and quickly led over to the lake.  The trails coming back down we're lovely, and vacant - worth a trip in their own right.", "date": "5 days ago"}, {"comment": "We had a wonderful hike up the Woody Trail to the upper falls. We then crossed over to the DNR road to Wallace Lake. The road that leads north off of the DNR road toward the lake was flooded all the way across in a couple of places.

I highly recommended the lake loop!", "date": "Apr 15, 2018"}, {"comment": "I arrived at the trailhead around 8:30 and the parking lot is ~1/3 full. I took the Woody Trail to the falls. The trail was generally in good condition -- snow free until the middle falls view point, but became a bit icy and slippery from the middle falls to the upper falls view point. I forgot my\u00a0Yaktrax home\u00a0but thankfully still had my poles, so\u00a0everything went fine. I saw quite a few folks with just sneakers, which seemed to be a little dangerous.At the upper falls view point I considered turning back to the trailhead, thinking if it was icy on the way to Wallace Lake it wouldn't be so much fun. However, I didn't want to go down the slippery slope, so decided to continue north to the forestry road to Wallace Lake.The first section of the forestry road was covered with thin snow (~3-5 in), but probably about 2/3 of the latter section was covered by fairly thick snow (~1 ft). There were compact\u00a0tracks from previous hikers, so I switched back and forth between the compact\u00a0paths (often with holes as usually found for paths formed by hiking\u00a0boots instead of snowshoes) and soft snow. I arrived at the lake ~11:40 and had lunch there.From Wallace Lake I took the Greg Ball Trail + Woody Trail back. It was an easy descent.\u00a0The soft snow and muds\u00a0felt nice.
